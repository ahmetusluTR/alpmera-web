# ALPMERA

## PHASE 0–1 PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT (PRD)

**Status:** Canonical
**Owner:** Architect & Execution Brain
**Audience:** Engineering, Product, Risk, Legal, Operations
**Scope:** Phase 0 (Foundations) + Phase 1 (Controlled Launch)

---

## 1. EXECUTIVE INTENT

Alpmera is a **private collective buying system** for people who understand that leverage is not negotiated individually — it is coordinated.

Through **private campaigns and escrow-secured commitments**, Alpmera converts shared intent into enforceable purchasing power, without urgency, exposure, or persuasion.

This document defines:

* the **minimum system** required to earn trust
* the **constraints** that preserve legitimacy
* the **conditions under which Alpmera deserves to continue**

This is not a growth document.
It is a **credibility document**.

> **Trust before price.
> Rules before growth.
> Completion before scale.**

---

## 2. DOCTRINE & NON-NEGOTIABLE PRINCIPLES

### 2.1 What Alpmera Is

* A **private coordination layer** between buyers and suppliers
* A **neutral clearing house** that enforces rules
* Escrow-first by default
* Campaign-driven by intent, not inventory

Alpmera does not sell products.
It organizes **serious participation**.

---

### 2.2 What Alpmera Is Not

* Not a store
* Not a reseller
* Not a discount engine
* Not a public marketplace
* Not a social or promotional platform

If it resembles any of the above, it is misaligned.

---

### 2.3 Trust Doctrine

* Trust is finite and fragile
* One ambiguous failure costs more than ten successes recover
* Any unclear money flow is a system defect

Alpmera favors **restraint over persuasion** and **process over promises**.

---

## 3. TARGET USER & PROBLEM

### 3.1 Primary User

* U.S.-based professionals
* Comfortable committing **$500–$3,000**
* Skeptical of advertising-driven pricing
* Willing to wait if rules are explicit and enforced
* Values privacy and procedural clarity

They are not chasing deals.
They are avoiding manipulation.

---

### 3.2 Problem Alpmera Solves

Premium buyers lack a **credible mechanism** to exercise collective leverage without:

* opaque pricing
* unclear fund handling
* supplier non-performance
* emotional or social pressure

Alpmera provides structure where:

* commitment creates leverage
* escrow enforces discipline
* rules protect everyone equally

---

## 4. PHASE 0 — FOUNDATIONS

### 4.1 Purpose

Phase 0 exists to validate three truths only:

1. Users understand and accept escrow-based commitments
2. Suppliers respect explicit acceptance rules
3. Failure can be handled without trust erosion

If any fail, Alpmera stops.

---

### 4.2 Explicit Non-Goals

Phase 0 does **not** optimize for:

* scale
* conversion
* automation
* virality
* engagement mechanics

This phase proves **worthiness**, not momentum.

---

### 4.3 System Boundaries

**Included**

* Admin-created campaigns
* User commitments
* Escrow hold / release / refund
* Manual supplier acceptance
* Manual dispute handling

**Excluded**

* Supplier self-service
* User communication
* Referrals
* Public discovery
* Automated payouts

---

### 4.4 Campaign State Machine (Immutable)

1. **AGGREGATION**
2. **SUCCESS**
3. **FAILED**
4. **FULFILLMENT**
5. **RELEASED**

No skips.
All transitions logged and auditable.

---

### 4.5 Money Flow (Protocol-Level)

* Funds are authorized and locked at commitment
* No supplier access before acceptance
* Release only after fulfillment confirmation
* Refunds automatic on failure

Money handling is treated as **infrastructure**, not UX.

---

### 4.6 Supplier Rules

* Suppliers do not list products
* They respond to verified demand
* Acceptance is explicit and binding
* Performance history is recorded

Suppliers are participants, not owners.

---

### 4.7 User Trust Signals

**Visible**

* Rules
* Escrow explanation
* State progression
* Refund guarantees

**Hidden**

* Supplier margins
* User identities
* Internal risk flags

Opacity prevents gaming; it does not reduce fairness.

---

### 4.8 Phase 0 Stop Conditions

* Escrow disputed publicly
* Refunds fail or delay
* Supplier breaches post-acceptance
* Trust ambiguity emerges

No iteration through trust loss.

---

## 5. PHASE 1 — CONTROLLED OPERATION

### 5.1 Purpose

Phase 1 validates:

* repeatability
* operational discipline
* trust preservation under light scale

---

### 5.2 Core Journey

1. Doctrine-first landing
2. Campaign explanation
3. Commitment decision
4. Escrow confirmation
5. Resolution outcome
6. Transparent closure

---

### 5.3 UX Philosophy

* Calm, restrained design
* High whitespace
* Minimal actions
* Rules before buttons

The interface should feel **confident, not persuasive**.

---

### 5.4 Escrow Language Rules

Escrow language must remain:

* factual
* neutral
* explicit

No motivational framing.
No emotional promises.

---

### 5.5 Admin Authority

Admins may:

* freeze campaigns
* force refunds
* delay releases
* resolve disputes
* annotate decisions

Admin power exists to **protect trust**, not optimize revenue.

---

### 5.6 Metrics That Matter

**North Star**

* Campaigns completed correctly

**Supporting**

* Refund execution time
* Supplier reliability
* Post-resolution trust sentiment

Ignored:

* GMV
* DAU
* conversion rates

---

## 6. FAILURE CONTAINMENT

* Campaigns isolated
* No shared balances
* Supplier failures quarantined
* Communication procedural, not emotional

---

## 7. EXIT CONDITIONS (PHASE 1)

Phase 1 ends only when:

* multiple campaigns complete cleanly
* at least one failure handled correctly
* users express confidence post-resolution
* suppliers respect consequences

Only then may scaling be discussed.

---

## 8. FINAL NOTE

Alpmera is not fast.
It is not loud.
It is not everywhere.

It is **deliberate**.

> **Alpmera exists for people who understand that collective power
> is not negotiated — it is enforced by structure.**
