# Alpmera – Marketing Strategy

## Purpose

This document defines Alpmera’s official marketing strategy.

All outreach, messaging, and growth activities must align with this plan and with Alpmera’s core doctrine.

Alpmera marketing is built on trust, education, and transparency — not hype.

---

# 1. Core Marketing Philosophy

Alpmera marketing follows three non-negotiable principles:

1. Educate before selling  
2. Trust before growth  
3. Clarity before conversion  

We do not chase volume.  
We earn confidence.

## Fundamental Positioning

Alpmera is:

> A trust-first platform that helps communities unlock better outcomes through collective buying power.

Alpmera is NOT:

- A discount site  
- A flash-sale platform  
- A deal aggregator  
- A reseller  

Marketing must always reinforce this distinction.
