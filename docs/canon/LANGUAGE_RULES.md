# Alpmera – Language Rules

## Purpose

This document defines the mandatory communication rules for all Alpmera-related content, including:

- Website copy  
- UI text  
- Marketing materials  
- Support responses  
- Legal documentation  
- Investor presentations  
- Internal communication  

Language is core to Alpmera’s identity.  
Using the wrong terminology breaks the trust model.

---

# 1. Core Principle

Alpmera is a coordination platform — not a store.

Therefore:

> Words that imply retail transactions must never be used.

---

# 2. Foundational Rule

### Users do not buy.
### Users join campaigns and commit funds to escrow.

This is the conceptual heart of Alpmera.

---

# 3. Forbidden Words and Phrases

The following terms must **never** be used in Alpmera communications:

| Forbidden Term | Reason |
|----------------|--------|
| buy | Implies Alpmera is a seller |
| order | Suggests traditional e-commerce |
| purchase | Frames Alpmera as a retailer |
| discount | Misrepresents collective pricing |
| checkout | Retail shopping flow language |
| cart | E-commerce metaphor |
| deal | Positions Alpmera as a deal site |
| sale | Implies Alpmera sets prices |
| price drop | Suggests dynamic retail pricing |
| customer | Implies seller-buyer relationship |
| we sell | Alpmera does not sell products |
| buy from Alpmera | Structurally incorrect |
| order confirmation | There are campaign commitments |

If any content contains these words, it is incorrect by definition.

# 4. Required Terminology

Use these terms instead:

| Concept | Correct Alpmera Term |
|-------|--------------------|
| Buying | Joining a campaign |
| Paying | Committing funds |
| Order | Campaign commitment |
| Checkout | Joining process |
| Cart | Commitment summary |
| Deal | Campaign |
| Discount | Collective price |
| Sale | Campaign pricing |
| Purchase | Escrow commitment |

- join  
- commit  
- participate  
- pledge  
- contribute  
- collaborate  
- pool demand  
- reach target  
- fulfill

These verbs reinforce the collective model.

# 6. Correct Framing Examples

### ❌ Incorrect

- “Buy with credit card”

### Always say:

- “Commit funds to escrow”

# 8. Pricing Language

Alpmera does not create discounts.

# 10. Status Terminology

Use the following lifecycle language:

| Stage | Correct Term |
|------|--------------|
| Not started | Draft campaign |
| Open for joining | Active campaign |
| Goal reached | Target achieved |
| Waiting for supplier | Pending acceptance |

# 11. UI Text Guidelines

All interface text must follow these patterns:

- “Join Campaign”

- “View Campaign Details”
- “Target Quantity”
- “Escrow Protected”
- “Campaign Progress”

Buttons must never say:

---

# 12. Marketing Voice

Tone must be:

- Transparent  
- Educational  
- Calm  
- Patient

Never:

- Aggressive  
- Urgency-driven  
- Hype-based  
- Deal-centric  

---

# 13. Legal and Compliance Framing

Always clarify:

- Alpmera is not the seller  
- Alpmera facilitates coordination  
- Funds are escrow-protected  
- Supplier is responsible for fulfillment  

---

# 14. Rule Enforcement

Any content that violates these language rules must be:

- Rewritten  
- Corrected  
- Rejected  

There are no exceptions.

## Final Reminder

Language is product design at Alpmera.

If the words sound like e-commerce,  
the message is wrong.
