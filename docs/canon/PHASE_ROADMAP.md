# Alpmera – Phase Roadmap

## Purpose

This document defines the official staged execution roadmap for Alpmera.

All product, engineering, marketing, and operational decisions must align with the phase structure described here.

Alpmera is intentionally built step-by-step to minimize risk and maximize learning.

---

# Strategic Vision

Alpmera will evolve in controlled stages from:

**“A small, trust-first private campaign tool”**

into

**“A scalable global collective buying coordination platform.”**

Each phase adds capability without breaking core principles.

# Guiding Principles

Across all phases:

- Trust-first architecture  
- Escrow-based protection  
- No hype marketing  
- Real demand only  
- Operational simplicity  
- Sustainable growth  

Features are added only when necessary and validated.
