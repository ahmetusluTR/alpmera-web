# Alpmera — Brand System (Canon)

**Canon Layer:** Brand / UX Doctrine
**Status:** ACTIVE — Mandatory Compliance
**Applies To:** Website, Web App, Admin UI, Marketing, Design Assets, AI-generated visuals

---

## 1. Brand Definition (Non‑Negotiable)

Alpmera is a **trust‑first collective buying operator**.

Alpmera is **not** a store, not a marketplace, and not a deal site.

The brand must communicate:

* Institutional trust
* Operational discipline
* Collective coordination
* Calm authority

The brand must **never** communicate:

* Urgency
* Salesmanship
* Retail excitement
* Discounts or deals

> **If it feels like e‑commerce, it violates Canon.**

---

## 2. Visual Identity Pillars

All visual decisions must reinforce these pillars:

1. **Trust before attraction**
2. **Clarity before persuasion**
3. **Process before promise**
4. **Calm before excitement**
5. **Durability before trendiness**

Design exists to **reduce anxiety**, not increase conversion pressure.

---

## 3. Logo System

### 3.1 Primary Mark

* Geometric, restrained, non‑literal
* No shopping metaphors
* No arrows, carts, price tags, badges, or flames
* Must work in monochrome

The logo should suggest:

* Containment
* Aggregation
* Locking / completion

Not:

* Speed
* Growth hacks
* Sales momentum

### 3.2 Usage Rules

* Always allow generous white (or neutral) space
* Never place on busy imagery
* Never animate for excitement — animation may only signal **state change**

### 3.3 Minimum Sizes

* Digital: 24px height minimum
* Print: 10mm height minimum

---

## 4. Color System — Trust‑First Palette

### 4.1 Core Principle

Color exists to **orient and reassure**, not to sell.

No harsh whites. No aggressive reds. No neon accents.

### 4.2 Primary Colors

**Deep Sapphire**
`#0F2043`
Use: headers, primary surfaces, institutional grounding

**Cloud Dancer**
`#F0EDE5`
Use: backgrounds, containers, primary canvas

### 4.3 Accent Colors

**Matte Copper**
`#B87333`
Use: primary actions (Join / Commit), sparingly

**Eucalyptus**
`#4A5D4E`
Use: success states, completion, confirmation

### 4.4 Prohibited Color Usage

* No red for urgency
* No green for profit
* No color‑coding that implies discounts or savings

---

## 5. Typography System

### 5.1 Core Philosophy

Typography must feel:

* Financial
* Editorial
* Calm
* Serious

Never playful. Never trendy.

### 5.2 Heading Typeface

High‑contrast modern serif.

Purpose:

* Authority
* Deliberateness
* Long‑term credibility

### 5.3 Body Typeface

Highly legible sans serif.

Rules:

* Minimum size: **16px** (enforced)
* Clear numerals for data
* Tabular numbers where possible

Typography must **reduce cognitive load**.

---

## 6. UI Component Doctrine

### 6.1 Buttons

Buttons represent **commitment**, not impulse.

Rules:

* No flashing
* No bouncing
* No urgency copy

Primary buttons:

* Join Campaign
* Commit Funds

Never:

* Buy Now
* Order
* Checkout

### 6.2 Interaction Feedback

* Physical, subtle, grounded
* Pressed = deliberate action acknowledged
* Never celebratory

---

## 7. Progress & Status Visualization

### Core Rule

Progress indicators must:

* Show **state**, not hype
* Avoid explicit percentages when possible
* Prevent reverse‑engineering of economics

Progress exists to answer:

> “Where am I?”

Not:

> “How excited should I be?”

---

## 8. Imagery Guidelines

### Allowed

* Materials
* Products under inspection
* Manufacturing environments
* Abstract textures
* Neutral, natural lighting

### Forbidden

* Smiling people
* Lifestyle marketing
* Handshakes
* Celebration imagery
* Fake collaboration visuals

Imagery should feel **quiet, precise, real**.

---

## 9. Iconography

* Simple line icons
* Rounded geometry
* Functional meaning only

Icons explain — they do not decorate.

---

## 10. Language Reinforcement (Brand + Copy)

All brand surfaces must comply with:

* `LANGUAGE_RULES.md`

Brand visuals must **never contradict language doctrine**.

If a visual implies retail behavior, it is invalid — even if the text is correct.

---

## 11. Enforcement Rule

Any asset that:

* Feels salesy
* Creates urgency
* Looks like e‑commerce
* Optimizes for excitement

**Must be rejected.**

Brand violations are trust violations.

---

## Final Principle

> Alpmera’s brand should feel like a **responsible institution**, not a growth startup.

Calm design builds trust.
Trust builds participation.
