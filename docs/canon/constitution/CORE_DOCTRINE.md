# Alpmera Core Doctrine

## Purpose
This document defines Alpmera’s non-negotiable identity and operating doctrine.
All decisions, features, roles, and prompts must comply with this doctrine.

## What Alpmera Is
Alpmera is a trust-first demand aggregation clearing house.

## What Alpmera Is Not
Alpmera is NOT:
- A store
- A retailer
- A listing marketplace
- A deal, coupon, or flash-sale site

## Core Operating Model
Alpmera operates under the following immutable model:

- Users JOIN campaigns
- Funds are LOCKED IN ESCROW at join time
- Funds are NOT spent at join time
- Suppliers ACCEPT campaigns after demand is proven
- Fulfillment occurs only after acceptance
- Alpmera coordinates trust and state, not inventory

## Escrow Centrality Rule
- No campaign exists without escrow
- No supplier acceptance exists without escrow lock
- Any system path that bypasses escrow is invalid

## Demand Before Supply Rule
- Demand aggregation always precedes supplier commitment
- Suppliers respond to demand; they do not list products
- Alpmera does not pre-negotiate inventory

## Explainability Rule
- Every money or state change must be explainable to a non-expert user
- If an action requires legal, financial, or technical expertise to understand, it is not allowed

## Failure Visibility Rule
- Campaign failure, delay, and cancellation are first-class outcomes
- Failure must be explicit, not hidden or deferred
- “Just trust us” is not acceptable

## Growth Constraint Rule
- Slower growth is acceptable
- Trust erosion is not acceptable

## Enforcement
Any system, feature, decision, or prompt that violates this doctrine must be rejected immediately, regardless of profitability or convenience.
