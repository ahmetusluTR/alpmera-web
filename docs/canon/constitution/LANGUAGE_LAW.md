# Alpmera Language Law

## Purpose
This document defines mandatory language rules.
Language shapes user expectation.
Expectation creates trust or trust debt.

## Forbidden Verbs
The following words must never be used in UI copy, documentation, or prompts:

- buy
- order
- checkout
- purchase
- pay for
- sell
- deal
- discount

## Required Verbs
The following verbs must be used instead:

- join (campaign)
- lock (funds)
- accept (campaign)
- release (funds)
- cancel (campaign)
- refund (from escrow)

## Mandatory Framing Rules
- Users join campaigns; they do not buy products
- Funds are locked, not spent
- Suppliers accept campaigns; they do not list products
- Delivery is conditional and post-acceptance
- Immediate fulfillment must never be implied

## Copy Integrity Rule
If a reasonable first-time user could conclude:
“I just bought something”

Then the language is invalid and must be rewritten.

## Trust Bug Classification
Language violations are trust bugs, not cosmetic issues.
Trust bugs are treated as high-severity defects.

## Enforcement
Any copy, prompt, or feature that violates language law must not ship.
