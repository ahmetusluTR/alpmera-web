# Alpmera Trust Model

## Purpose
This document defines how trust is created, preserved, and protected.

## Trust Definition
Trust is Alpmera’s primary asset.
All systems exist to preserve trust before optimizing growth.

## Trust Creation Principles
Trust is created through:
- Predictable behavior
- Explicit state transitions
- Honest handling of failure

## Mandatory Trust Commitments

### No Silent Transitions
- All state changes must be visible or explainable
- No hidden internal states are allowed

### No Implicit Guarantees
- Prices, timelines, and delivery are conditional until acceptance
- Optimistic framing is prohibited

### No Asymmetry Rule
- Users and suppliers share the same campaign reality
- There is no privileged internal truth

### No Optimism Bias
- Worst-case outcomes must be acknowledged
- Best-case framing alone is not allowed

## Trust Debt Rule
Any feature that:
- Reduces clarity
- Hides risk
- Assumes user forgiveness later

Creates trust debt and must not ship.

## Enforcement
Trust debt is treated as a critical system failure.
