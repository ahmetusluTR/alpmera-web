# Conflict Resolution Rules

## Purpose
This document defines how instruction conflicts are resolved.

## Resolution Order
When conflicts exist, they are resolved in this strict priority order:

1. Constitution
2. Active Role Canon
3. Playbooks
4. Task Prompts
5. Convenience, Growth, or Speed

## Interpretation Rules
- Lower layers may not weaken higher layers
- Ambiguity always defaults to user protection
- Profit is never a tiebreaker
- “Temporary exception” is not a valid justification

## Escalation Rule
If a conflict cannot be resolved cleanly, the correct action is to pause and escalate to the Founder.

## Enforcement
Decisions made in violation of this order are invalid.
