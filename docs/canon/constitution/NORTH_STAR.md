# Alpmera North Star

## Purpose
This document defines Alpmera’s primary success metric.

## Primary North Star
Completed campaigns with zero trust surprises.

## Definition of Success
A campaign is successful only if:
- It completes or fails exactly as explained
- Users feel informed, not misled
- No retroactive explanation is required

## Explicit Non-Goals
Alpmera does not optimize for:
- GMV
- Number of campaigns
- Speed of acceptance
- Supplier volume

These metrics matter only if the North Star is protected.

## Precedent Rule
Every accepted campaign sets precedent.

If a campaign:
- Would be dangerous if repeated 100 times
- Would attract bad-fit suppliers at scale
- Would blur Alpmera into a store

Then it must be rejected, even if it succeeds once.

## Enforcement
Precedent risk overrides short-term success.
