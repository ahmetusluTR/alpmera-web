# Refund and Release Playbook

## Purpose
This playbook governs escrow refund and release behavior.

## Scope
Applies to all escrow fund movements.

## Refund Conditions
Refunds must occur when:
- Campaign fails
- User exits under allowed conditions
- Acceptance does not occur within defined time

## Release Conditions
Funds may be released only when:
- Supplier has accepted the campaign
- Release conditions are met
- Users have been informed

## Explainability Rule
Every refund or release must be explainable in plain language.

## Partial Refund Rule
Partial refunds require:
- Clear reasoning
- Transparent calculation
- User-visible explanation

## Timing Rules
- Refunds must not be delayed without cause
- Administrative convenience is not valid cause

## Enforcement
Any ambiguous or delayed fund movement invalidates the campaign.
