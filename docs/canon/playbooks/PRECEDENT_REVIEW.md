# Precedent Review Playbook

**Canon Layer:** Playbook  
**Trust Model Compliance:** Mandatory  
**Parent Documents:** Constitution, Trust Model, North Star

---

## Purpose

This playbook governs precedent risk evaluation.

---

## Scope

Applies to all campaign approvals.

---

## Trust Model Integration

This playbook enforces the following Trust Model commitments:

| Trust Model Principle | Application in This Playbook |
|-----------------------|------------------------------|
| No Silent Transitions | Precedent decisions must be documented and visible |
| No Implicit Guarantees | Approving one campaign does not guarantee future approvals |
| No Asymmetry | Precedent rules apply equally to all suppliers |
| No Optimism Bias | Precedent must be evaluated for worst-case scaling |
| Trust Debt Rule | Precedents that reduce future clarity create trust debt |

Precedent is trust at scale. A single decision that succeeds but creates harmful patterns is a trust debt that compounds over time.

---

## Precedent Definition

A precedent is any pattern that future suppliers or users may expect to repeat.

Per the Trust Model's **No Implicit Guarantees** principle:
- Approval of one campaign does not create entitlement to future approvals
- However, patterns of approval create reasonable expectations
- Those expectations become implicit guarantees if not managed

Precedent review exists to prevent implicit guarantees from forming through unexamined repetition.

---

## Precedent Evaluation Rules

Campaigns must be reviewed for:

| Evaluation Criterion | Trust Model Basis |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Scalability of behavior** | No Optimism Bias — assume this will repeat 100x |
| **Supplier signaling effects** | No Asymmetry — what message does this send? |
| **System identity drift** | Trust Debt Rule — does this blur Alpmera into a store? |

---

## Repetition Test

**If a campaign would be harmful when repeated at scale, it must be rejected.**

This test operationalizes the Trust Model's **No Optimism Bias** principle:
- Do not assume "this is a one-time exception"
- Do not assume "we'll handle it differently next time"
- Do not assume "this supplier is special"

Assume the worst case: this exact pattern repeats 100 times with suppliers who have no goodwill.

---

## Attraction Risk Rule

**If a campaign would attract bad-fit suppliers, it must be rejected.**

Per the Trust Model's **No Asymmetry** principle:
- Suppliers observe what Alpmera accepts
- Acceptance signals what Alpmera is
- Bad-fit acceptances attract bad-fit suppliers

A campaign that succeeds but attracts suppliers who expect Alpmera to be a store creates trust debt at the supplier layer.

---

## Identity Drift Test

**If a campaign would blur Alpmera into a store, it must be rejected.**

Per the Trust Debt Rule, any decision that **reduces clarity** about what Alpmera is creates trust debt.

Ask: Would a reasonable observer, seeing this campaign, conclude that Alpmera is a store, retailer, or deal site?

If yes, the campaign fails the identity drift test regardless of its individual merits.

---

## Override Rule

**Profitability does not override precedent risk.**

Per the Constitution's Conflict Resolution hierarchy:
1. Constitution
2. Active Role Canon
3. Playbooks
4. Task Prompts
5. Convenience, Growth, or Speed

Precedent risk is a constitutional concern (North Star, Identity). Profitability is a Layer 5 concern. Layer 5 may not override Layer 0.

---

## Trust Model Enforcement Checklist

Before approving any campaign, confirm:

- [ ] Precedent decision is documented (No Silent Transitions)
- [ ] Approval does not create implicit entitlement (No Implicit Guarantees)
- [ ] Decision applies the same standard to all suppliers (No Asymmetry)
- [ ] Campaign evaluated for worst-case 100x repetition (No Optimism Bias)
- [ ] Campaign does not blur Alpmera's identity (Trust Debt Rule)

---

## Enforcement

Precedent risk overrides short-term success.

A campaign that succeeds individually but harms Alpmera's trust model at scale is a net negative. Per the Trust Model, trust debt is treated as a critical system failure — even when it's deferred.
