# Precedent Review Playbook

## Purpose
This playbook governs precedent risk evaluation.

## Scope
Applies to all campaign approvals.

## Precedent Definition
A precedent is any pattern that future suppliers or users may expect to repeat.

## Precedent Evaluation Rules
Campaigns must be reviewed for:
- Scalability of behavior
- Supplier signaling effects
- System identity drift

## Repetition Test
If a campaign would be harmful when repeated at scale, it must be rejected.

## Attraction Risk Rule
If a campaign would attract bad-fit suppliers, it must be rejected.

## Override Rule
Profitability does not override precedent risk.

## Enforcement
Precedent risk overrides short-term success.
