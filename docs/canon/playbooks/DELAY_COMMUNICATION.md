# Delay Communication Playbook

**Canon Layer:** Playbook  
**Trust Model Compliance:** Mandatory  
**Parent Documents:** Constitution, Trust Model

---

## Purpose

This playbook governs how campaign delays are communicated.

---

## Scope

Applies to all delays after campaign join.

---

## Trust Model Integration

This playbook enforces the following Trust Model commitments:

| Trust Model Principle | Application in This Playbook |
|-----------------------|------------------------------|
| No Silent Transitions | Delays are state changes and must be communicated immediately |
| No Implicit Guarantees | Original timelines were conditional; delays must not imply new guarantees |
| No Asymmetry | Users receive the same delay information as internal teams |
| No Optimism Bias | Delay messaging must acknowledge worst-case scenarios |
| Trust Debt Rule | Downplaying or hiding delays creates trust debt |

---

## Delay Definition

A delay is any deviation from the previously communicated timeline.

Per the Trust Model's **No Silent Transitions** principle, a delay is a state change and must be treated as such — visible, logged, and communicated.

---

## Communication Rules

- Delays must be communicated **immediately upon confirmation** *(Trust Model: No Silent Transitions)*
- Delay messaging must be **explicit and factual** *(Trust Model: No Optimism Bias)*
- Optimistic framing is prohibited *(Trust Model: No Optimism Bias — worst-case outcomes must be acknowledged)*

---

## Required Delay Disclosure

Per the Trust Model's **No Asymmetry** principle, delay communication must include everything internal teams know:

| Required Element | Rationale |
|------------------|-----------|
| What changed | Users must understand the state transition |
| Why it changed | Honest handling of failure (Trust Creation Principle) |
| New expected timeline | Conditional, not guaranteed (No Implicit Guarantees) |
| User options | Exit path must be clear |

---

## User Option Rule

When delays occur, users must be given clear options:

- **Continue participation** — With explicit acknowledgment of new timeline
- **Exit and receive refund** — If applicable under campaign rules

Withholding exit options when delays occur violates the **No Asymmetry** rule — users must have the same power to respond to new information as Alpmera does.

---

## Language Constraints

| Prohibited | Required | Trust Model Basis |
|------------|----------|-------------------|
| Reassurance without explanation | Explanation first, then next steps | No Optimism Bias |
| Vague timelines ("soon," "shortly") | Specific dates or explicit uncertainty | No Implicit Guarantees |
| Implied guarantees ("don't worry") | Conditional framing | No Implicit Guarantees |
| Minimization ("slight delay") | Factual magnitude | Trust Debt Rule |

---

## Trust Model Enforcement Checklist

Before sending any delay communication, confirm:

- [ ] Delay is communicated immediately, not batched or deferred (No Silent Transitions)
- [ ] Messaging does not imply new guarantees (No Implicit Guarantees)
- [ ] Users receive the same information as internal teams (No Asymmetry)
- [ ] Worst-case scenario is acknowledged (No Optimism Bias)
- [ ] Language does not minimize, hide, or assume forgiveness (Trust Debt Rule)

---

## Enforcement

Uncommunicated or downplayed delays are trust violations.

Per the Trust Model, trust debt is treated as a critical system failure. Delay mishandling triggers immediate review.
