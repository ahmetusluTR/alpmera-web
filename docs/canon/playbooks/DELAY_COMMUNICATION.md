# Delay Communication Playbook

## Purpose
This playbook governs how campaign delays are communicated.

## Scope
Applies to all delays after campaign join.

## Delay Definition
A delay is any deviation from the previously communicated timeline.

## Communication Rules
- Delays must be communicated immediately upon confirmation
- Delay messaging must be explicit and factual
- Optimistic framing is prohibited

## Required Delay Disclosure
Delay communication must include:
- What changed
- Why it changed
- What the new expected timeline is
- What options users have

## User Option Rule
When delays occur, users must be given clear options:
- Continue participation
- Exit and receive refund (if applicable)

## Language Constraints
- No reassurance without explanation
- No vague timelines
- No implied guarantees

## Enforcement
Uncommunicated or downplayed delays are trust violations.
