# Supplier Onboarding Playbook

**Canon Layer:** Playbook  
**Trust Model Compliance:** Mandatory  
**Parent Documents:** Constitution, Trust Model, Core Doctrine

---

## Purpose

This playbook defines how suppliers enter the Alpmera system.

---

## Scope

Applies to all suppliers without exception.

---

## Trust Model Integration

This playbook enforces the following Trust Model commitments:

| Trust Model Principle | Application in This Playbook |
|-----------------------|------------------------------|
| No Silent Transitions | Onboarding status must be explicit and tracked |
| No Implicit Guarantees | Onboarding does not guarantee campaign acceptance |
| No Asymmetry | Suppliers operate under the same truth as users |
| No Optimism Bias | Supplier expectations must reflect actual constraints |
| Trust Debt Rule | Onboarding that creates misaligned expectations is trust debt |

Supplier onboarding is where asymmetry risk is highest. Suppliers who believe they have privileged access, special treatment, or implicit guarantees create trust debt that compounds through every campaign.

---

## Supplier Eligibility Rules

Suppliers must explicitly accept:

| Requirement | Trust Model Basis |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Escrow mechanics | Core Doctrine: Escrow Centrality |
| Delayed fulfillment expectations | No Implicit Guarantees — timing is conditional |
| Transparency requirements | No Asymmetry — suppliers share user reality |

Suppliers unwilling to operate under these conditions are ineligible.

### Eligibility Is Not Negotiable

Per the Trust Model's **No Asymmetry** rule, there are no tiers of supplier privilege. A supplier who expects:
- Faster fund release than policy allows
- Reduced transparency requirements
- Implicit acceptance guarantees

Is ineligible, regardless of volume, brand, or relationship.

---

## Onboarding Disclosure Rules

Suppliers must be informed of:

| Disclosure | Trust Model Basis |
|------------|-------------------|
| Campaign acceptance mechanics | No Implicit Guarantees — acceptance is not automatic |
| Failure and cancellation outcomes | No Optimism Bias — worst case must be acknowledged |
| Refund responsibilities | No Silent Transitions — supplier knows when refunds occur |

### No Privileged Expectations

Per the **No Asymmetry** rule, suppliers must not be given information, assurances, or expectations that differ from what users understand.

Prohibited onboarding language:
- "We'll make sure your campaigns get accepted"
- "Don't worry about the escrow timeline"
- "We can be flexible on the rules"

This language creates implicit guarantees and asymmetry. It is trust debt.

---

## Trust Alignment Rule

**Suppliers must operate under the same truth as users.**

This is a direct application of the Trust Model's **No Asymmetry** principle:
- There is no privileged internal truth
- Users and suppliers share the same campaign reality

Operationally, this means:
- Suppliers see the same campaign rules users see
- Suppliers receive the same failure explanations users receive
- Suppliers have no private channel to override user-facing policies

---

## First-Time Supplier Rule

First-time suppliers represent elevated trust risk. They require:

| Requirement | Trust Model Basis |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Higher scrutiny | No Optimism Bias — do not assume good behavior |
| Lower initial exposure | Trust Debt Rule — limit blast radius of potential failure |
| Clear exit paths | No Silent Transitions — removal process is explicit |

### Rationale

Per the Trust Model's **No Optimism Bias** principle:
- Do not assume a new supplier will perform well
- Do not assume problems will be minor
- Do not assume relationship will overcome issues

First-time suppliers must prove alignment before receiving expanded access.

---

## Trust Model Enforcement Checklist

Before completing supplier onboarding, confirm:

- [ ] Onboarding status is tracked and visible (No Silent Transitions)
- [ ] Supplier understands that onboarding ≠ acceptance guarantee (No Implicit Guarantees)
- [ ] Supplier has no privileged expectations vs. users (No Asymmetry)
- [ ] Supplier has been informed of failure/cancellation outcomes (No Optimism Bias)
- [ ] Onboarding did not create misaligned expectations (Trust Debt Rule)

---

## Enforcement

Suppliers violating onboarding conditions must be removed from eligibility.

Per the Trust Model, asymmetry between supplier expectations and user reality is a critical defect. Suppliers who cannot accept alignment must not enter the system.

Onboarding violations trigger immediate review and potential removal.
