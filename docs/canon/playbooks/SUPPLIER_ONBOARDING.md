### **Supplier Qualification & Alignment Playbook**

**Canon Layer:** Playbook
**Trust Model Compliance:** Mandatory
**Parent Documents:** Constitution, Trust Model, Core Doctrine
**Operational Context:** Phase 1–2 Operator Model

---

## Purpose

This playbook defines how suppliers are **qualified, aligned, and approved** to work with Alpmera during Phase 1–2.

It governs the process by which Alpmera selects suppliers as operational partners for campaigns that Alpmera fully owns and executes.

---

## Scope

Applies to all suppliers working with Alpmera in Phase 1–2.

**This is not platform onboarding.**
It is **operational partner qualification.**

---

# PHASE 1–2 REALITY FRAME

For Phase 1–2:

* Alpmera is an **end-to-end campaign operator**
* Alpmera designs and owns campaigns
* Alpmera collects funds
* Alpmera purchases from suppliers
* Alpmera manages fulfillment
* Alpmera issues refunds if campaigns fail

Therefore:

> Suppliers are contractors to Alpmera, not platform users.

All onboarding must reflect this truth.

---

# Trust Model Integration

This playbook enforces:

| Trust Principle        | Application                                        |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| No Silent Transitions  | Supplier status changes must be explicit           |
| No Implicit Guarantees | Qualification never guarantees future business     |
| No Asymmetry           | Suppliers must operate under the same public rules |
| No Optimism Bias       | Operational limits must be clearly acknowledged    |
| Trust Debt Rule        | Misaligned supplier expectations are prohibited    |

---

# Supplier Eligibility Requirements

To work with Alpmera, suppliers must explicitly accept:

| Requirement                            | Rationale                        |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Alpmera owns the campaigns             | Operator model compliance        |
| Alpmera controls customer funds        | Financial responsibility clarity |
| Alpmera manages customer communication | No Asymmetry                     |
| Fulfillment timelines are conditional  | No Implicit Guarantees           |
| Refunds are Alpmera’s responsibility   | Clear role separation            |
| Delivery SLAs are binding              | Operational reliability          |

---

## Non-Negotiable Conditions

Suppliers who expect any of the following are **ineligible**:

* direct access to customer funds
* privileged exceptions to Alpmera rules
* guaranteed campaign volume
* visibility into Alpmera economics
* influence over user-facing policies

These expectations create asymmetry and are prohibited.

---

# Onboarding Disclosure Rules

Suppliers must be clearly informed of:

| Disclosure                                | Purpose                   |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Campaigns are designed by Alpmera         | Role clarity              |
| Participation levels determine purchasing | No Implicit Guarantees    |
| Alpmera may cancel campaigns              | Worst-case acknowledgment |
| Payment occurs only after success         | Financial discipline      |
| Performance history is recorded           | Accountability            |

---

## Prohibited Onboarding Language

The following are forbidden:

* “Your campaigns will definitely run”
* “We can bend the rules for you”
* “Don’t worry about the timelines”
* “We’ll make exceptions”

Any such language creates trust debt.

---

# First-Time Supplier Rule

New suppliers represent elevated risk.

Therefore:

| Requirement                  | Reason                  |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Limited initial exposure     | Contain blast radius    |
| Smaller first campaign sizes | Reduce operational risk |
| Enhanced verification        | Avoid optimism bias     |
| Clear termination path       | No Silent Transitions   |

No supplier receives expanded cooperation until proven.

---

# Competitive Safety Rule

During onboarding Alpmera must **never disclose**:

* internal margins
* cost structures
* pricing tier logic
* total campaign economics
* other supplier terms

Transparency is limited to:

* process
* responsibilities
* operational expectations

Economics remain intentionally opaque.

---

# Operational Alignment Checklist

Before approving any supplier:

* [ ] Supplier understands Alpmera is campaign owner
* [ ] Supplier accepts conditional timelines
* [ ] Supplier agrees to fulfillment SLAs
* [ ] Supplier understands payment conditions
* [ ] No privileged expectations created
* [ ] No economic information requested
* [ ] Status recorded in audit log

---

# Approval Process

Supplier qualification is:

* explicit
* revocable
* campaign-specific
* performance-dependent

**Qualification ≠ guarantee of campaigns.**

---

# Enforcement

Suppliers who violate:

* agreed timelines
* communication rules
* quality expectations
* confidentiality boundaries

must be suspended or removed.

Protection of user trust overrides supplier relationships.

---

# Core Principle

> Suppliers must adapt to Alpmera’s operating model.
> Alpmera never adapts its trust model to suppliers.
