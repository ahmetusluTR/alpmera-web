# Campaign Acceptance Playbook

## Purpose
This playbook defines the standard procedure for accepting or rejecting campaigns.

## Scope
Applies to all supplier-proposed campaigns without exception.

## Preconditions
- A supplier proposal exists
- Campaign parameters are defined
- Escrow mechanics are available

## Acceptance Procedure
Campaigns must be evaluated using the Marketplace Gatekeeper framework.

The following must be explicitly confirmed:
- Doctrine fit
- Identified risks and failure modes
- Operability clarity
- Precedent impact

## Allowed Outcomes
- Accept
- Accept with Constraints
- Defer
- Reject

No other outcomes are valid.

## Constraint Rule
Constraints must be:
- Explicit
- Enforceable by system or operations
- Visible to users when relevant

Soft or trust-based constraints are invalid.

## Rejection Rule
Campaigns must be rejected if:
- Doctrine is violated
- User harm is irreversible
- Operability is unclear
- Precedent risk is unacceptable

## Enforcement
Campaigns may not proceed without a valid acceptance decision.
