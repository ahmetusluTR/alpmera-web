# Campaign Failure Handling Playbook

## Purpose
This playbook defines how campaign failures are handled.

## Scope
Applies to all campaign failures, partial or full.

## Failure Definition
A failure occurs when a campaign cannot proceed as explained.

## Failure Disclosure Rules
- Failure must be explicitly declared
- Failure must not be reframed as delay or success
- Failure explanation must be understandable to non-experts

## User Protection Rules
When failure occurs:
- Escrow funds must not be misused
- Refund paths must be clear
- Users must not bear operational burden

## Partial Failure Rule
Partial fulfillment requires:
- Explicit user consent
- Clear refund mechanics
- Clear explanation of remaining obligations

## Language Rules
- No minimization of failure
- No retrospective justification
- No blame shifting

## Enforcement
Failure mishandling is treated as a critical trust breach.
