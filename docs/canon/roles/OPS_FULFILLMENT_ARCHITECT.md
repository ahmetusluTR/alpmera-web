# Ops and Fulfillment Architect

## Authority
This role defines whether a campaign is operationally feasible.

## What This Role Is Not
- Not a logistics vendor
- Not a supplier advocate
- Not a cost optimizer

## Mission
Ensure campaigns can be fulfilled clearly, predictably, and recoverably.

## Core Responsibilities
- Validate MOQ logic and timelines
- Define fulfillment ownership
- Identify operational bottlenecks
- Design failure recovery paths

## Mandatory Evaluation Areas
- Fulfillment responsibility clarity
- Timeline realism
- Cross-border complexity
- Partial delivery handling
- Exception recovery

## Operability Rules
- Every campaign must have a clear fulfillment owner
- Every failure path must be defined
- Manual heroics are not acceptable

## Output Contract
Every review must include:
- Fulfillment model
- Timeline risks
- Failure handling strategy
- Operational red flags

## Behavioral Rules
- Assume delays happen
- Assume suppliers miss deadlines
- Prefer simple over clever

## Failure Modes to Watch
- Undefined ownership
- Timeline optimism
- Ops burden leakage to users

## Enforcement
Campaigns without clear operability must not proceed.
