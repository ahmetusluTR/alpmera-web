# Alpmera – Overview

## 1. What Alpmera Is

Alpmera is a **trust-first, private collective buying platform** that enables communities to pool real demand and unlock better pricing and terms directly with suppliers.

Alpmera is not a store, not a flash-sale site, and not a discount marketplace.

Instead, Alpmera operates as a structured coordination layer where:

- Users **join campaigns**
- Funds are **committed to escrow**
- Suppliers **accept campaigns**
- Goods are delivered only after commitments reach viability

Alpmera’s core mission is to convert fragmented individual purchasing power into organized, transparent collective leverage.

## 2. What Alpmera Is NOT

Alpmera is explicitly NOT:

- An online retailer  
- A reseller  
- A drop-shipping platform  
- A daily deals site  
- A speculative group-buy platform  

Alpmera does not “sell products.”

It facilitates **collective purchasing campaigns between communities and suppliers.**

---

## 3. Core Philosophy

Alpmera is built on the following foundational principles:

### Trust-First

- Buyer protection comes before platform profit  
- Funds remain in escrow until fulfillment  
- Risk is distributed transparently  
- Every campaign has clear, enforceable rules  

### Real Demand Only

- No fake discounts  
- No artificial urgency  
- No speculative orders  
- No misleading pricing  

Campaigns represent genuine aggregated intent from real people.

### Platform Over Deal Site

Alpmera is designed to be a long-term coordination platform, not a one-time deal engine.

Success is measured by:

- Campaigns completed  
- Trust earned  
- Communities served  
- Supplier relationships strengthened  

---

## 4. Language Rules (Non-Negotiable)

To preserve conceptual clarity, Alpmera uses strict terminology.

### Allowed Terms

- Join a campaign  
- Commit funds  
- Escrow  
- Target quantity  
- Campaign completion  
- Supplier acceptance  
- Fulfillment  
- Collective buying  
- Community power  

### Forbidden Terms

Never describe Alpmera using:

- “Buy”  
- “Order”  
- “Discount”  
- “Purchase from Alpmera”  
- “Checkout”  
- “Deal site”  

Correct framing:

> Users join campaigns and commit funds to escrow.

---

## 5. How Alpmera Works (High Level)

1. A campaign is created around a specific product  
2. Users join and commit funds  
3. Funds stay in escrow  
4. When the target is reached, the supplier is invited  
5. Supplier accepts and agrees to terms  
6. Funds are released only after successful fulfillment  

No campaign = no transaction  
No completion = no payment to supplier  

---

## 6. Target Users

Alpmera is designed for:

- Smart, patient buyers  
- Communities with shared needs  
- Professionals and hobbyist groups  
- Value-conscious families  
- Small businesses  
- Organized buyer collectives  

The platform favors:

- High-ticket products  
- Durable goods  
- Non-perishable items

---

## 7. Business Model

Alpmera earns through:

- Transparent platform fees  
- Success-based revenue

Revenue is generated only when real value is delivered.
