# Alpmera Constitution

**Status:** Proposed for Ratification  
**Authority Level:** Layer 0 (Supreme)  
**Supersedes:** All other canon documents in case of conflict

---

## Preamble

This Constitution defines Alpmera's immutable identity, non-negotiable principles, and supreme operating constraints. It exists to prevent drift, preserve trust, and ensure institutional coherence across all decisions, systems, features, and communications.

No document, decision, or circumstance may override this Constitution.

---

## Article I — Identity

### §1.1 What Alpmera Is

Alpmera is a trust-first demand aggregation clearing house.

It is:
- A private coordination layer between buyers and suppliers
- A neutral clearing house that enforces rules
- Escrow-first by default
- Campaign-driven by intent, not inventory

Alpmera does not sell products. It organizes serious participation.

### §1.2 What Alpmera Is Not

Alpmera is NOT:
- A store
- A retailer
- A reseller
- A listing marketplace
- A discount engine
- A deal, coupon, or flash-sale site
- A public marketplace
- A social or promotional platform

If it resembles any of the above, it is misaligned and must be corrected.

---

## Article II — Trust Supremacy

### §2.1 Trust as Primary Asset

Trust is Alpmera's primary asset. All systems exist to preserve trust before optimizing growth.

### §2.2 Trust Doctrine

- Trust is finite and fragile
- One ambiguous failure costs more than ten successes recover
- Any unclear money flow is a system defect
- Alpmera favors restraint over persuasion and process over promises

### §2.3 Trust Creation Principles

Trust is created through:
- Predictable behavior
- Explicit state transitions
- Honest handling of failure

### §2.4 Growth Constraint

Slower growth is acceptable. Trust erosion is not acceptable.

---

## Article III — Mandatory Prohibitions

### §3.1 No Silent Transitions

All state changes must be visible or explainable. No hidden internal states are allowed.

### §3.2 No Implicit Guarantees

Prices, timelines, and delivery are conditional until acceptance. Optimistic framing is prohibited.

### §3.3 No Asymmetry

Users and suppliers share the same campaign reality. There is no privileged internal truth.

### §3.4 No Optimism Bias

Worst-case outcomes must be acknowledged. Best-case framing alone is not allowed.

### §3.5 No Trust Debt

Any feature that reduces clarity, hides risk, or assumes user forgiveness later creates trust debt and must not ship. Trust debt is treated as a critical system failure.

---

## Article IV — Operating Model

### §4.1 Campaign Flow (Immutable Sequence)

1. Users JOIN campaigns
2. Funds are LOCKED IN ESCROW at join time
3. Funds are NOT SPENT at join time
4. Suppliers ACCEPT campaigns after demand is proven
5. Fulfillment occurs only after acceptance
6. Alpmera coordinates trust and state, not inventory

### §4.2 Escrow Centrality

- No campaign exists without escrow
- No supplier acceptance exists without escrow lock
- Any system path that bypasses escrow is invalid

### §4.3 Demand Before Supply

- Demand aggregation always precedes supplier commitment
- Suppliers respond to demand; they do not list products
- Alpmera does not pre-negotiate inventory

### §4.4 Money Flow Protocol

- Funds are authorized and locked at commitment
- No supplier access before acceptance
- Release only after fulfillment confirmation
- Refunds automatic on failure
- Money handling is infrastructure, not UX

---

## Article V — Explainability & Failure

### §5.1 Explainability Rule

Every money or state change must be explainable to a non-expert user. If an action requires legal, financial, or technical expertise to understand, it is not allowed.

### §5.2 Failure Visibility Rule

Campaign failure, delay, and cancellation are first-class outcomes. Failure must be explicit, not hidden or deferred. "Just trust us" is not acceptable.

---

## Article VI — North Star

### §6.1 Primary Success Metric

Completed campaigns with zero trust surprises.

### §6.2 Definition of Success

A campaign is successful only if:
- It completes or fails exactly as explained
- Users feel informed, not misled
- No retroactive explanation is required

### §6.3 Explicit Non-Goals

Alpmera does not optimize for:
- GMV
- Number of campaigns
- Speed of acceptance
- Supplier volume
- DAU
- Conversion rates

These metrics matter only if the North Star is protected.

### §6.4 Precedent Rule

Every accepted campaign sets precedent. If a campaign would be dangerous if repeated 100 times, would attract bad-fit suppliers at scale, or would blur Alpmera into a store, it must be rejected even if it succeeds once. Precedent risk overrides short-term success.

---

## Article VII — Language Law

### §7.1 Language Shapes Trust

Language shapes user expectation. Expectation creates trust or trust debt.

### §7.2 Forbidden Terms

The following words must never be used in UI copy, documentation, or prompts:
- buy
- order
- checkout
- purchase
- pay for
- sell
- deal
- discount

### §7.3 Required Terms

The following terms must be used:
- join (campaign)
- lock (funds)
- accept (campaign)
- release (funds)
- cancel (campaign)
- refund (from escrow)

### §7.4 Copy Integrity Rule

If a reasonable first-time user could conclude "I just bought something," the language is invalid and must be rewritten.

### §7.5 Trust Bug Classification

Language violations are trust bugs, not cosmetic issues. Trust bugs are treated as high-severity defects.

---

## Article VIII — Conflict Resolution

### §8.1 Resolution Order

When conflicts exist, they are resolved in this strict priority order:

1. Constitution (this document)
2. Active Role Canon
3. Playbooks
4. Task Prompts
5. Convenience, Growth, or Speed

### §8.2 Interpretation Rules

- Lower layers may not weaken higher layers
- Ambiguity always defaults to user protection
- Profit is never a tiebreaker
- "Temporary exception" is not a valid justification

### §8.3 Escalation Rule

If a conflict cannot be resolved cleanly, the correct action is to pause and escalate to the Founder.

### §8.4 Enforcement

Decisions made in violation of this order are invalid.

---

## Article IX — Stop Conditions

### §9.1 Immediate Stop Triggers

Alpmera must stop and reassess if:
- Escrow is disputed publicly
- Refunds fail or delay
- Supplier breaches post-acceptance
- Trust ambiguity emerges

### §9.2 No Iteration Through Trust Loss

There is no iteration through trust loss.

---

## Article X — Enforcement

### §10.1 Rejection Mandate

Any system, feature, decision, prompt, or communication that violates this Constitution must be rejected immediately, regardless of profitability, convenience, growth potential, or external pressure.

### §10.2 Canon Authority

The Canon (Constitution, Roles, Playbooks, Tasks) defines Alpmera's non-negotiable doctrine. All reasoning, analysis, and outputs must comply with the Canon. If any instruction, prompt, or request conflicts with the Canon, the Canon takes precedence and the conflict must be surfaced rather than bypassed.

### §10.3 Immutability

This Constitution may not be overridden by convenience, optimization, or speculative assumptions.
