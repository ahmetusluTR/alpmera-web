# Alpmera – UX Baseline Rules

## Purpose

This document defines the mandatory user experience and interface standards for Alpmera.

All current and future interfaces—admin console, user-facing pages, and internal tools—must comply with these rules.

The goal is simple:

> Consistent, clear, trust-first UX everywhere.

---

# 1. Core UX Philosophy

Alpmera UX is built on five pillars:

1. Clarity over cleverness  
2. Trust over excitement  
3. Transparency over persuasion  
4. Simplicity over features  
5. Consistency over novelty  

Every screen must feel:

- Calm  
- Predictable  
- Professional  
- Financially responsible  

---

# 2. Doctrine Alignment

UX must reinforce Alpmera’s identity as:

- A coordination platform  
- An escrow-first system  
- A trust-driven marketplace  

All screens must follow the official:

`LANGUAGE_RULES.md`

No UX element may imply retail e-commerce behavior.

---

# 3. Universal Visual Contract

### Rule U-1: Consistent Structure

All Alpmera pages must share:

- Predictable header  
- Clear primary action  
- Logical hierarchy  
- Stable navigation  

No “surprise layouts.”

---

### Rule U-2: Admin Lists Visual Contract

All admin console list pages must follow this baseline pattern:

- Same column alignment  
- Same row spacing  
- Same action placement  
- Same filtering layout  
- Same pagination controls  
- Same button styles  

Every list must feel like the same product.

---

### Rule U-3: Alignment Discipline

- Labels must align vertically  
- Inputs must share widths  
- Buttons must be consistently placed  
- Icons must use the same sizing  
- Tables must align by data type  

No visual drift between pages.

---

# 4. Navigation Rules

### Rule N-1: Predictable Paths

Users must always know:

- Where they are  
- What they can do  
- How to go back  
- What happens next  

Avoid hidden actions.

---

### Rule N-2: Minimal Navigation

Only show what is necessary:

- No feature clutter  
- No decorative menus  
- No premature options  

Phase-based simplicity.

---

# 5. Action Design

### Rule A-1: Clear Primary Actions

Every page must have:

- One obvious primary action  
- Secondary actions clearly separated  
- Destructive actions visually distinct  

Never more than one “main” button.

---

### Rule A-2: Button Language

Buttons must follow Alpmera terminology:

✅ Correct:

- Join Campaign  
- Commit Funds  
- View Details  
- Accept Campaign  
- Close Campaign  

❌ Forbidden:

- Buy Now  
- Order  
- Checkout  
- Purchase  

---

# 6. Form Design

### Rule F-1: Forms Must Be Boring

Good Alpmera forms are:

- Simple  
- Linear  
- Clearly labeled  
- Error-preventing  

No experimental UI patterns.

---

### Rule F-2: Validation

All forms must include:

- Clear error messages  
- Inline validation  
- Helpful hints  
- Safe defaults  

Never blame the user.

---

# 7. Information Architecture

### Rule I-1: Progressive Disclosure

Show:

- What the user needs now  

Hide:

- What they don’t  

Complexity must unfold gradually.

---

### Rule I-2: Data First

Campaign pages must prioritize:

1. Target quantity  
2. Progress  
3. Escrow protection  
4. Timeline  
5. Terms  

Marketing copy is secondary.

---

# 8. Trust Signals

Every critical flow must display:

- Escrow status  
- Clear guarantees  
- Refund logic  
- Supplier responsibilities  
- What happens if the campaign fails  

Trust information must never be hidden.

---

# 9. Error Handling

### Rule E-1: Calm Errors

Error messages must be:

- Human  
- Helpful  
- Actionable  
- Non-technical  

No stack traces to users.

---

### Rule E-2: Safe Recovery

Users must always have:

- A clear next step  
- A way to undo  
- A way to contact support  

---

# 10. Accessibility

### Minimum Standards

- High color contrast  
- Readable font sizes  
- Keyboard navigation  
- Screen-reader friendly labels  
- Mobile-first layouts  

Accessibility is not optional.

---

# 11. Mobile Experience

### Rule M-1: Mobile First

All screens must be:

- Fully responsive  
- Touch-friendly  
- Simple on small screens  

Admin console included.

---

# 12. Visual Tone

The Alpmera interface should feel:

- Financial  
- Responsible  
- Neutral  
- Professional  

Avoid:

- Flashy animations  
- Aggressive colors  
- Salesy visuals  

---

# 13. Copy in UX

All interface text must be:

- Short  
- Clear  
- Literal  
- Non-marketing  

UI copy explains; it does not sell.

---

# 14. Consistency Mandate

If a pattern exists anywhere in Alpmera:

It must be reused everywhere.

No custom one-off designs.

---

# 15. Change Governance

Any new UI element must answer:

- Does this follow language rules?  
- Does this match existing layouts?  
- Is it consistent with admin patterns?  
- Does it increase trust?  

If not, redesign it.

---

## Final Principle

> Boring UX is good UX for Alpmera.

Predictability builds confidence.
