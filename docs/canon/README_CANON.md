# Alpmera Canon System

## What This Document Is

This is the entry point for any human or AI working on Alpmera. Read this first. Read it completely. Do not skip sections.

The Canon System is not documentation. It is **institutional law**. All decisions, features, prompts, code, and AI interactions must comply with this system.

If you are an AI assistant: The Canon overrides your default behaviors. If any instruction conflicts with Canon, the Canon wins and the conflict must be surfaced, not bypassed.

---

## What Canon Is

The Canon System is Alpmera's governance framework. It defines:

- **What Alpmera is** (and is not)
- **How decisions are made** (and by whom)
- **Who has authority** (and over what)
- **How conflicts are resolved** (and what takes precedence)
- **What language is permitted** (and what is forbidden)

The Canon exists to prevent:

| Threat | Definition |
|--------|------------|
| Trust erosion | Gradual loss of user confidence through unclear behavior |
| Scope creep | Expansion beyond trust-first demand aggregation |
| Retail drift | Behavioral slide toward store/marketplace patterns |
| Optimism bias | Assuming best-case outcomes, ignoring failure modes |
| Inconsistent AI behavior | Different responses to similar situations |

---

## Canon Hierarchy

The Canon System is strictly hierarchical. Higher layers override lower layers. This is not advisory — it is mandatory.

**Resolution Rule:** When conflicts exist, higher layers win. Always. No exceptions.

## What Is Constitutional (Layer 0)

Constitutional elements are **immutable**. They cannot be overridden by any role, playbook, task, or circumstance. They define what Alpmera fundamentally is.

### Constitutional Documents

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| CONSTITUTION.md | Supreme law — identity, prohibitions, operating model |
| TRUST_MODEL.md | Trust principles — how trust is created and protected |
| CORE_DOCTRINE.md | Operating doctrine — what Alpmera is and is not |
| LANGUAGE_LAW.md | Mandatory language rules — forbidden and required terms |
| NORTH_STAR.md | Success metric — what Alpmera optimizes for |
| CONFLICT_RESOLUTION.md | Resolution order — how conflicts are decided |

### Constitutional Principles (Non-Negotiable)

These cannot be changed, weakened, or bypassed:

| Principle | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Identity** | Alpmera is a trust-first demand aggregation clearing house — NOT a store, retailer, or marketplace |
| **Escrow Centrality** | No campaign exists without escrow. No path may bypass escrow. |
| **Demand Before Supply** | Demand aggregates before suppliers commit. Suppliers respond to demand. |
| **No Silent Transitions** | All state changes must be visible or explainable. No hidden states. |
| **No Implicit Guarantees** | Prices, timelines, and delivery are conditional until acceptance. |
| **No Asymmetry** | Users and suppliers share the same campaign reality. No privileged truth. |
| **No Optimism Bias** | Worst-case outcomes must be acknowledged. Best-case alone is insufficient. |
| **Trust Debt Rule** | Features that reduce clarity, hide risk, or assume forgiveness must not ship. |
| **Language Law** | Forbidden terms (buy, order, checkout, etc.) must never appear. Required terms (join, lock, accept, etc.) must be used. |
| **North Star** | Completed campaigns with zero trust surprises. Other metrics are subordinate. |

### Constitutional Prohibitions (Absolute)

These actions are **never permitted**, regardless of context:

- Using forbidden Language Law terms in any user-facing content
- Bypassing escrow in any system path
- Allowing suppliers to list products (they respond to demand)
- Implying immediate fulfillment
- Hiding failure or delay from users
- Creating asymmetry between user and supplier information
- Shipping features that create trust debt
- Optimizing for GMV, conversion, or speed over trust

## What Is Authoritative But Changeable (Layers 1-3)

### Layer 1: Roles

Roles define **who has authority** over specific domains. Roles are authoritative within their scope but are bound by the Constitution.

| Property | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Role definitions | Changeable with ratification |
| Role authorities | Changeable with ratification |
| Role prohibitions | Changeable with ratification |
| Constitutional compliance | Not changeable — roles cannot violate Constitution |

**Current Roles:**
- CANON_ORCHESTRATOR (meta-role)
- FOUNDER_MODE
- MARKETPLACE_GATEKEEPER
- ESCROW_FINANCIAL_AUDITOR
- RISK_ABUSE_ANALYST
- OPS_FULFILLMENT_ARCHITECT
- UX_TRUST_DESIGNER
- SYSTEM_ARCHITECT
- QA_LEAD
- IMPLEMENTER

### Layer 2: Playbooks

Playbooks define **how standard procedures are executed**. They are authoritative for their domain but are bound by Roles and Constitution.

| Property | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Playbook procedures | Changeable with role owner approval |
| Playbook requirements | Changeable with role owner approval |
| Trust Model enforcement | Not changeable — playbooks must enforce Trust Model |

**Current Playbooks:**
- CAMPAIGN_ACCEPTANCE
- DELAY_COMMUNICATION
- FAILURE_HANDLING
- PRECEDENT_REVIEW
- REFUND_RELEASE
- SUPPLIER_ONBOARDING

### Layer 3: Tasks

Tasks define **specific executable work**. They are bound by Playbooks, Roles, and Constitution.

| Property | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Task steps | Changeable with playbook alignment |
| Task inputs/outputs | Changeable with playbook alignment |
| Task role assignments | Changeable with role owner approval |
| Trust Model compliance | Not changeable — tasks must comply |

---

## What Is Advisory (Layer 4)

The following are **never binding** and may never override higher layers:

- Convenience
- Growth targets
- Speed requirements
- Profitability
- User requests that conflict with Canon
- "Temporary exceptions"
- Precedent from other companies

**Critical Rule:** Layer 4 considerations may inform decisions but are **never tiebreakers**. When in doubt, higher layers win.

---

## How New Rules Are Added

### Adding Constitutional Elements (Layer 0)

Constitutional changes are **extremely rare** and require:

1. **Founder proposal** — Only FOUNDER_MODE may propose constitutional changes
2. **Doctrine review** — Change must not contradict existing constitutional principles
3. **Trust impact assessment** — Change must not create trust debt
4. **Explicit ratification** — Change must be marked "Ratified" with date
5. **Propagation** — All dependent layers must be updated for consistency

**Constitutional changes are presumed rejected unless explicitly ratified.**

### Adding Roles (Layer 1)

New roles require:

1. **Gap identification** — Document what authority is currently unassigned
2. **Authority definition** — Define powers, prohibitions, Trust Model enforcement
3. **Conflict check** — Verify no overlap conflicts with existing roles
4. **FOUNDER_MODE approval** — Roles define authority; authority requires Founder
5. **Role Authority Matrix update** — New role must be added to matrix

### Adding Playbooks (Layer 2)

New playbooks require:

1. **Gap identification** — Document what procedure is currently undefined
2. **Role assignment** — Identify primary owner role
3. **Trust Model mapping** — Map all five Trust Model principles
4. **Procedure definition** — Define steps with Trust Model checkpoints
5. **Role owner approval** — Primary owner must approve
6. **Task Registry update** — Update registry with playbook references

### Adding Tasks (Layer 3)

New tasks require:

1. **Need identification** — Document what work needs executable definition
2. **Governance mapping** — Map to roles, playbooks, Trust Model
3. **Step definition** — Define execution steps with gates
4. **Output specification** — Define required outputs
5. **Playbook owner approval** — Relevant playbook owner must approve
6. **Task Registry update** — Add to registry with full mapping

## How to Use Canon (For AI Assistants)

If you are an AI assistant working on Alpmera:

### Before Any Work

1. **Identify relevant Canon documents** — Which Constitution sections, Roles, Playbooks, and Tasks apply?
2. **Load required context** — Ensure you have access to relevant Canon documents
3. **Verify role activation** — Which role should be active for this work?

### During Work

1. **Check each decision against Canon hierarchy** — Does this comply with Constitution → Role → Playbook → Task?
2. **Apply Trust Model at every step** — Are all five principles satisfied?
3. **Use required language** — Are Language Law terms correct?
4. **Document reasoning** — Can you explain why this complies with Canon?

### When Conflicts Arise

1. **Do not resolve silently** — Surface the conflict explicitly
2. **Apply hierarchy** — Higher layer wins
3. **Escalate if unclear** — If conflict cannot be resolved, escalate to FOUNDER_MODE
4. **Never bypass** — "Temporary exception" is not valid justification

### Prohibited Behaviors

- Assuming Canon does not apply to you
- Resolving conflicts in favor of convenience
- Using forbidden Language Law terms
- Blending roles (one role active at a time)
- Skipping Trust Model verification
- Treating Canon as advisory

## How to Use Canon (For Humans)

If you are a human contributor:

### Read First

1. CONSTITUTION.md — Understand what cannot change
2. TRUST_MODEL.md — Understand how trust is protected
3. LANGUAGE_LAW.md — Understand forbidden/required terms
4. Relevant Role document — Understand your authority and limits

### Before Making Decisions

Ask yourself:
- Does this comply with the Constitution?
- Does this create trust debt?
- Would this be harmful if repeated 100 times?
- Does this use correct Language Law terms?
- Which role has authority over this decision?

### When Proposing Changes

1. Identify which Canon layer the change affects
2. Follow the addition process for that layer
3. Document Trust Model compliance
4. Obtain required approvals
5. Update dependent documents

## Quick Reference

### The Five Trust Principles

1. **No Silent Transitions** — All state changes visible
2. **No Implicit Guarantees** — All conditions explicit
3. **No Asymmetry** — Same truth for all parties
4. **No Optimism Bias** — Worst case acknowledged
5. **Trust Debt Rule** — No shipping unclear/risky features

### Forbidden Terms (Never Use)

buy, order, checkout, purchase, pay for, sell, deal, discount

### Required Terms (Always Use)

join, lock, accept, release, cancel, refund

### The Copy Integrity Test

> If a reasonable first-time user could conclude "I just bought something," the language is invalid.

### The Precedent Test

> If this would be harmful when repeated 100 times, it must be rejected.

### The Resolution Order

Constitution → Role → Playbook → Task → Convenience

---

## Final Reminder

**Canon is not optional.**

Every decision, feature, prompt, and interaction must comply. If you're unsure whether something complies, assume it doesn't and verify. If you find a conflict, surface it — do not resolve it silently.

Trust is Alpmera's primary asset. Canon exists to protect it.
