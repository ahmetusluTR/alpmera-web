# Alpmera Branding Package — Figma Design Prompt

**Prepared from Visual Identity Specifications by Lena Varma**  
**Design Trends:** Nature Distilled + Neo-Minimalism (2026)

---

## Project Overview

Create a complete branding package for **Alpmera**, a trust-first demand aggregation clearing house. The visual identity must communicate institutional security, collective power, and operational precision — distinctly positioned away from retail/marketplace aesthetics toward an "Operations House" identity.

---

## 1. Logo System: "The Locked Batch"

### Primary Logo Mark
Design a **Fluid Geometric monogram 'A'** that subtly morphs into a chain link or container shape. The form should suggest security, aggregation, and connection without literal imagery.

**Specifications:**
- Clean geometric construction with fluid curves
- Negative space should hint at interlocking or containment
- Must work as both static mark and animation-ready asset

### Adaptive Logo Variants
Create responsive versions following the "Adaptive Logos" trend:

| Context | Treatment |
|---------|-----------|
| Mobile Favicon (16×16, 32×32) | Simplified single-stroke version, shed all texture |
| Standard Digital | Clean vector, no texture |
| Desktop Hero / High-Res | Brushed steel metallic texture overlay |
| Print / Premium | Embossed/debossed ready version |

### Wordmark: Kinetic Typography Concept
Design the "ALPMERA" wordmark with **variable letter-spacing** that can animate:
- **Default state:** Standard professional spacing
- **"Batch filling" state:** Letters subtly compress together
- Include animation keyframe guides showing compression sequence

### Logo Clear Space & Sizing
- Minimum clear space: Height of the 'A' mark on all sides
- Minimum digital size: 24px height
- Minimum print size: 10mm height

## 3. Typography System: "The Engineer's Serif"

### Heading Typeface
**Style:** High-Contrast Modern Serif (similar to Editorial New, Freight Display, or Canela)

- Communicates: High-end editorial, Operations House, not Tech Startup
- Weights needed: Regular, Medium, Bold
- Sizes: H1 (48-64px), H2 (36-40px), H3 (24-28px), H4 (20px)

### Body Typeface
**Style:** Super-Legible Sans Serif (similar to Inter, Untitled Sans, or Söhne)

- Priority: Maximum legibility for data display
- Minimum size: 16px (enforced for "Data Honesty")
- Weights needed: Regular, Medium, Semibold, Bold
- Include tabular/monospace numerals for data tables

### Type Scale
```
Display:    64px / 72px line-height
H1:         48px / 56px line-height  
H2:         36px / 44px line-height
H3:         24px / 32px line-height
H4:         20px / 28px line-height
Body:       16px / 24px line-height (minimum)
Caption:    14px / 20px line-height
Data/Mono:  14-16px / tabular numerals
```

### Blueprint Background Pattern
Create a subtle background texture for data-heavy sections:
- Fine grid lines suggesting architectural blueprints
- Very low opacity (3-5%) over Cloud Dancer background
- Evokes: Architect's desk, precision, planning

---

## 4. UI Components: "Immersive Minimalism"

### Surface Treatments

**Grainy Blur Effect**
- Subtle film grain texture overlay (opacity 2-4%)
- Use on modal backgrounds, elevated cards
- Creates analog, tactile premium feel

**Matte Paper Texture**
- Soft paper-like texture for primary backgrounds
- No harsh pure whites — always Cloud Dancer base

### Button System

**Primary CTA: "Commit Funds" Button**
Design with tactile 3D interaction states:

| State | Treatment |
|-------|-----------|
| Default | Matte Copper fill, subtle shadow, slight 3D elevation |
| Hover | Increased elevation, gentle glow |
| Active/Pressed | **Depress animation** — button physically sinks, mimicking a wax seal or stamp being pressed |
| Confirmed | Eucalyptus color transition, "sealed" visual state |

Include animation specifications:
- Press depth: 2-4px downward
- Duration: 150ms ease-out
- Optional: Subtle haptic feedback notation for mobile

### Card Components
- Rounded corners: 8-12px
- Shadow: Soft, diffused (avoid harsh drop shadows)
- Border: Optional 1px in Deep Sapphire at 10% opacity
- Background: Cloud Dancer with matte texture

---

## 5. Progress Visualization: "Orbital Progress System"

### Concept
Replace standard bar charts with circular, pulsing progress indicators to prevent competitor reverse-engineering.

### Design Specifications

**Structure:**
- Product image centered
- Circular glow ring surrounding the image
- Glow intensifies as batch nears completion

**States:**
| Completion | Visual Treatment |
|------------|------------------|
| 0-25% | Faint outer ring, barely visible pulse |
| 25-50% | Ring becomes visible, slow pulse rhythm |
| 50-75% | Ring brightens, pulse quickens, subtle particles |
| 75-99% | Intense glow, rapid pulse, "energy gathering" effect |
| 100% | Solid ring, flash transition, "locked" state |

**Animation Notes:**
- Pulse rhythm: Breathing animation (ease-in-out)
- Color: Gradient from Deep Sapphire to Matte Copper as completion increases
- Never show numerical percentages or linear axis

---

## 6. Imagery Guidelines: "Quiet Realism"

### Photo Direction

**DO Use:**
- High-detail macro shots of products being inspected
- Raw materials in natural lighting
- Hands examining quality (no faces needed)
- Abstract textures of materials (steel, fabric, components)
- The "Alpmera Vault" interface screenshots (stylized)
- Manufacturing environments (clean, precise)

**DO NOT Use:**
- Stock photos of smiling people
- Handshakes or generic "business" imagery
- Overly saturated colors
- Busy, cluttered compositions

### Image Treatment
- Slight desaturation toward Nature Distilled palette
- Soft vignettes
- Can overlay with grain texture for consistency

---

## 7. Iconography

### Style
- Line weight: 1.5-2px stroke
- Corners: Slightly rounded (2px radius)
- Grid: 24×24px base with 2px padding
- Style: Geometric, minimal detail

### Required Icons
- Lock/Security
- Batch/Container
- Progress/Momentum
- Verify/Check
- Aggregate/Collect
- Vault
- Document/Contract
