Fix Refunds + Refund Plans to be campaign-scoped, code-driven, and operationally safe.

SCOPE (ONLY):
- /admin/refunds: improve filters and reason display (no PII)
- /admin/refund-plans: redesign to be campaign-scoped and remove “guessing”
- Implement exportable reference tables for code-based fields (global rule)
- Add exports for eligible commitments for refund planning
- Keep execution out of scope (plans can remain draft/approved views)

GUARDRAILS:
- Do NOT allow manual refund amounts to be “trusted” from CSV.
- Amounts must be derived/validated from escrow ledger.
- Imports with code-based fields must use codes (not labels).
- No PII in refunds list.

REQUIREMENTS:

1) Refund Plans are campaign-scoped
- Update Refund Plans UI so admin selects a campaign context first (or navigate from Campaign detail to “Refund planning”).
- Provide “Export eligible commitments for refund” from the selected campaign.
- Then allow import of a refund plan CSV that references only eligible commitment_codes.

2) Refund Plan CSV template (codes)
Provide “Download CSV template”:
Required columns:
  commitment_code, reason_code
Optional:
  note
Do NOT require amount in the template.
If amount is currently required by backend, keep it but validate against escrow and reject mismatches; update template accordingly only if unavoidable.

3) Export: Eligible commitments for refund planning
Add export button (campaign-scoped):
- “Export eligible commitments (refund planning)”
CSV includes:
  commitment_code, refundable_amount, currency, current_status
(refundable_amount derived, for review only)

Backend endpoint (add if missing):
- GET /api/admin/campaigns/:campaignId/refunds/eligible/export

4) Export: Refund reason reference table (codes↔labels)
Add “Export reason reference (CSV)” accessible from Refund Plans page:
CSV columns:
  reason_code, label, description, scope, active
This table must be the source for operators to find codes.

Backend endpoint (add if missing):
- GET /api/admin/refunds/reasons/export

5) Refunds page improvements
- Status filter must match actual backend statuses.
- Reason column should display label (mapped from reason_code) with code as secondary text/tooltip.
- Ensure no user name/email is displayed or requested.

DELIVERABLE:
- Refund Plans are campaign-scoped with eligible export + code-based template.
- Refund reasons reference export exists.
- Refunds list shows reason labels (no PII).
- Short summary of changed files/endpoints.
