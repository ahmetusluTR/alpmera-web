You are working on the Alpmera web app (Replit AI applies changes). Implement Account → Payments & Escrow (Batch 3) using the existing backend, existing auth/session system, and the shared AccountShell + shared Timeline component.

STRICT RULES:
- NEVER use store language: buy, order, checkout, cart, purchase, deal, discount, flash.
- ONLY use: campaign, commitment, escrow, release, refund, fulfillment.
- Do NOT change database schema, triggers, ledger logic, idempotency, campaign state machine, or admin auth rules.
- Keep changes scoped to Account module: Payments & Escrow list + escrow movement detail + read-only API consumption.
- Optimize for low Replit credits: reuse existing components, types, utilities. No new heavy libs.
- No prices.

SCOPE OF THIS BATCH:
A) Payments & Escrow list page: /account/escrow  (already in nav as “Payments & Escrow”)
B) Escrow movement detail page: /account/escrow/:movementId (or :entryId if that matches existing ids)
C) Use shared AccountShell and shared Timeline (audit/append-only feel).
D) Read-only only. No state-changing actions.

AUTH GUARD:
- These routes must require authenticated session using existing /api/me-based guard.
- If unauthenticated, redirect to existing login flow (no auth logic changes).

DATA REQUIREMENTS (REUSE FIRST, MINIMAL NEW IF NEEDED):
1) Reuse any existing ledger endpoints already used by admin console or commitment wizard (search codebase).
   - Prefer: GET /api/account/escrow (list)
   - Prefer: GET /api/account/escrow/:movementId (detail)
2) If they don’t exist, add minimal NEW read-only endpoints under /api/account/* that query existing append-only escrow ledger tables/views.
   - Must respect append-only design (do not add UPDATE/DELETE).
   - Must not expose supplier-private pricing.
   - Must only return ledger entries belonging to the authenticated user.

PAYMENTS & ESCROW LIST UI:
- Table columns:
  - Movement date (createdAt)
  - Movement type (LOCK / RELEASE / REFUND or equivalent)
  - Amount
  - Currency
  - Status (if applicable: pending/posted/void; otherwise omit)
  - Reference (commitment code and/or campaign name, if available)
- Sorting: newest movement date first
- Row click → detail page

ESCROW MOVEMENT DETAIL UI:
1) Header:
   - “Escrow movement” + movement id (short)
   - Movement type + amount + date
2) Escrow snapshot card (read-only):
   - Show derived balances if available (e.g., “In Escrow”, “Released”, “Returned”) OR
     show a minimal snapshot: movement amount, currency, movement type, actor label (SYSTEM/ADMIN if safe), reason.
   - Important: do NOT store balances; only display derived values if backend provides them.
3) Ledger timeline (Timeline component):
   - Render related ledger entries in audit order (newest first is OK).
   - Each Timeline item should include:
     - title: e.g., “Escrow LOCK recorded”, “Escrow RELEASE recorded”, “Escrow REFUND recorded”
     - date
     - status (optional)
     - meta: actor, reason, idempotency key (if safe), commitmentCode, campaignId/code
   - Must feel append-only and “audit style”.
4) Links (read-only):
   - If campaign route exists, link: “View campaign”
   - If commitment detail exists and commitmentCode is known, link: “View commitment”
   - If delivery detail route exists and a delivery id exists, link: “View delivery”
   - Links must not introduce store language.

ERROR/EMPTY STATES:
- List loading: simple skeleton or “Loading…”
- Empty list: “No escrow movements yet.”
- Error: “Unable to load escrow movements.” with a Retry button.
- Detail not found: show “Movement not found.”

IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:
- Create minimal types:
  - EscrowMovementListItem
  - EscrowMovementDetail (includes entries[])
- Reuse existing date/number formatting utilities.
- Reuse existing Table/Card components if present.
- Ensure AccountShell nav highlights “Payments & Escrow” correctly.

ACCEPTANCE CHECKLIST:
- /account/escrow shows a table of escrow movements (no prices, no store language).
- Clicking a row opens /account/escrow/:movementId.
- Detail shows escrow snapshot + append-only ledger timeline using shared Timeline.
- Auth guard works; unauthenticated redirects.
- No regressions to commitments, campaign pages, or admin console.

After implementing:
- Provide a short summary: files changed/added, routes, which API endpoints were reused/created.
- Do not output large code dumps.
