You are working on the Alpmera web app (Replit AI applies changes). Implement Account → Refunds (Batch 4) using the existing backend, existing auth/session system, and the shared AccountShell + shared Timeline component.

STRICT RULES:
- NEVER use store language: buy, order, checkout, cart, purchase, deal, discount, flash.
- ONLY use: campaign, commitment, escrow, release, refund, fulfillment.
- Do NOT change database schema, triggers, escrow ledger logic, idempotency, campaign state machine, or admin auth rules.
- Keep changes scoped to Account module: Refunds list + refund detail page + read-only API consumption.
- Optimize for low Replit credits: reuse existing components, patterns, types, formatting utils. No new heavy libs.
- No prices.

SCOPE OF THIS BATCH (Refunds only):
A) Refunds list page: /account/refunds
B) Refund detail page: /account/refunds/:refundId (or :refundCode if that exists; prefer whatever is already used in admin/refund flows)
C) Use shared AccountShell and shared Timeline component (audit/append-only feel).
D) Read-only UI only. No state-changing actions.

AUTH GUARD:
- All routes must require authenticated session using the existing /api/me-based guard.
- If unauthenticated, redirect to the existing login flow (no auth logic changes).

DATA REQUIREMENTS (REUSE FIRST, MINIMAL NEW IF NEEDED):
1) Reuse existing refund endpoints already used by the admin console (search codebase):
   - Prefer: GET /api/account/refunds (list)
   - Prefer: GET /api/account/refunds/:refundId (detail)
   If these do not exist, implement minimal NEW read-only endpoints under /api/account/* that:
   - Query existing refund records / refund table(s) and/or escrow ledger entries related to refunds
   - Return ONLY refunds belonging to the authenticated user
   - Do NOT expose supplier-private pricing
   - Do NOT add update/delete; do not affect idempotency logic

REFUNDS LIST UI (/account/refunds):
- Table columns:
  - Refund date (initiatedAt or createdAt)
  - Refund status (e.g., INITIATED / PROCESSING / COMPLETED / FAILED; use actual enums if present)
  - Amount
  - Currency
  - Refund reference (refundId/refundCode)
  - Campaign (name if available)
  - Commitment code (if available)
- Sorting: newest refund date first
- Row click → refund detail
- Empty state: “No refunds yet.”
- Error: “Unable to load refunds.” with Retry

REFUND DETAIL UI (/account/refunds/:refundId):
1) Header:
   - “Refund” + refund reference
   - Current refund status
   - Amount + currency
2) Refund snapshot card (read-only):
   - Fields (best-effort depending on existing data):
     - Refund reference
     - Status
     - Amount + currency
     - Initiated date
     - Completed date (if present)
     - Reason (if present)
     - Related commitment code (if present)
     - Related campaign name (if present)
3) Refund lifecycle timeline (Timeline component):
   - Must feel append-only and audit-style.
   - Populate from whatever events exist (preferred sources in order):
     a) Dedicated refund events/status history table (if exists)
     b) Refund record timestamps (created/processed/completed/failed)
     c) Escrow ledger entries of type REFUND that reference this refund
   - Timeline item examples (use actual status values you have):
     - “Refund initiated”
     - “Refund processing”
     - “Refund completed”
     - “Refund failed”
   - Each item includes:
     - title
     - date
     - status (optional)
     - description/meta: actor (SYSTEM/ADMIN if safe), reason, idempotency key (if safe), ledger entry id (if safe)
4) Links (read-only):
   - “View campaign” → existing campaign detail route (if campaign id/slug exists)
   - “View commitment” → /account/commitments/:commitmentCode (if known)
   - “View escrow movement” or “View escrow ledger” → /account/escrow/:movementId or /account/escrow (best available)
   - Do not add any actions.

LOADING/ERROR/NOT FOUND:
- Loading: simple “Loading…” or minimal skeleton
- Not found: “Refund not found.”
- Error: “Unable to load refund.” with Retry

IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE:
- Add minimal types:
  - RefundListItem
  - RefundDetail (may include timeline source fields and related ids)
- Reuse existing date/number formatting utilities and existing Table/Card components if present.
- Ensure AccountShell nav highlights “Refunds” properly.

ACCEPTANCE CHECKLIST:
- /account/refunds shows a table with required columns, no store language.
- Clicking a row opens /account/refunds/:refundId.
- Detail shows refund snapshot + refund lifecycle timeline using shared Timeline.
- Detail includes read-only links back to campaign/commitment/escrow when possible.
- Auth guard works; unauthenticated redirects.
- No regressions to commitments, payments & escrow, campaign pages, or admin console.

After implementing:
- Provide a short summary: files changed/added, routes, and which API endpoints were reused/created.
- Do not output large code dumps.
