BATCH: Campaign Detail UI fixes + copy refinement (public/member-facing)

GOAL:
Fix remaining campaign detail UI leaks and improve wording to better match Alpmera’s trust-first, non-charity, non-store positioning.

STRICT GUARDRAILS:
- Do NOT change backend escrow, ledger, pricing logic, or campaign state machine.
- Do NOT add libraries.
- Do NOT change admin pages.
- Do NOT expose funding/target amounts publicly.
- Keep pricing visible ONLY where a user explicitly takes action (join/commit flow).
- Avoid store language (buy/order/cart/checkout).
- Avoid charity language (donate/help).

SCOPE (ONLY):
- Public/member Campaign Detail page (non-admin view)
- UI labels, copy, and conditional rendering
- No routing changes

--------------------------------------------------
FIXES (IN ORDER)
--------------------------------------------------

1) REMOVE funding + target amounts from Campaign Progress (CRITICAL)
- On the Campaign Detail page, remove:
  - “Funding $X / $Y”
  - Any numeric target or total dollar amounts
- Keep:
  - Progress bar
  - Percentage (if present)
  - Qualitative progress label (“Building momentum”, etc.)
- This applies to ALL non-admin users (public + signed-in members).

2) FIX status pill at top-left (“AGGREGATION”)
- Do NOT show raw internal status codes.
- Replace with UI-friendly label using the same mapping already agreed:
  - AGGREGATION → “Building momentum”
  - SUCCESS → “Target reached”
  - FULFILLMENT / RELEASED → “In fulfillment”
  - FAILED → “Not completed”
- Ensure this applies to:
  - Status pill at top-left
  - Any other status text on the page

3) RENAME “Aggregation deadline”
- Replace label text:
  - From: “Aggregation deadline”
  - To: “Campaign closes”
- Keep the date/time exactly as-is.
Reason:
- “Aggregation” is system language
- “Campaign closes” is human, neutral, non-commercial

4) REPLACE “Commitment” wording with a better alternative
The word “commitment” currently feels:
- charity-like (“donate”)
- vague
- emotionally misaligned

DO NOT change backend terminology or API fields.
This is UI copy only.

Apply the following replacements on Campaign Detail page:
- Button text:
  - From: “Make a Commitment”
  - To: “Join campaign”
- Section title:
  - From: “Commitment Details”
  - To: “Participation details”
- Line items:
  - “Minimum Commitment” → “Minimum participation”
  - “Unit Price” can remain IF this page is explicitly behind sign-in and action intent; otherwise hide until join flow.

If the page is visible before sign-in:
- Hide price fields entirely
- Show a neutral line:
  - “Participation terms shown after joining”

--------------------------------------------------
CONTENT CONSISTENCY CHECKS
--------------------------------------------------
- Ensure no $ amounts appear unless the user is:
  - signed in AND
  - explicitly in the join/participation flow
- Ensure no raw internal state names appear anywhere
- Ensure wording feels:
  - neutral
  - professional
  - non-charity
  - non-store

--------------------------------------------------
DELIVERABLE:
- Campaign detail page no longer leaks funding/target amounts.
- Status labels are human-friendly.
- Deadline label is improved.
- “Commitment” wording replaced with “Join campaign / Participation”.
- Brief list of files changed and what was adjusted (no large code dump).
