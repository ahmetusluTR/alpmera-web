You are working on Alpmera, a trust-first demand aggregation + escrow marketplace.

This task combines:
1) STRICT UI COPY updates (string replacements only)
2) Conversion-focused UI LOGIC (visibility, gating, urgency)
while minimizing Replit credits.

⚠️ NON-NEGOTIABLE DOCTRINE
- Users JOIN campaigns (never buy/order/checkout)
- Funds are locked in escrow conceptually
- Alpmera is not a store
- Do NOT expose private business info (targets, totals, escrow balances)

⚠️ GLOBAL ENGINEERING RULES
- Do NOT change layout, component structure, schemas, or routing
- Do NOT modify dynamic campaign data (titles, dates, counts, prices)
- Prefer string replacement and conditional rendering only
- Reuse existing components
- Implement in small batches

================================================
P0 — REQUIRED (Trust + Privacy + Correctness)
================================================

-----------------------------------------------
P0-A) UI COPY — STRING REPLACEMENTS ONLY
-----------------------------------------------

1) Hero subtitle (under campaign title)
Replace:
“A collective campaign where participants join together to reach a shared goal.”
With:
“Join others to reach a shared goal. Your money stays protected until the campaign is accepted.”

2) Status stepper labels (labels only, structure unchanged)
Replace:
- Building momentum → Gathering commitments
- Target reached → Goal reached
- In fulfillment → In execution
- Completed → Completed

Replace the status pill text everywhere:
- Building momentum → Gathering commitments

3) Meta info row labels (values remain dynamic)
Replace:
- Closes: → Ends:
- Progress: → Momentum:
- Participants: → Members:

4) Transparency section
Replace section title:
- Transparency → Trust & transparency

⚠️ Escrow Status card is already removed — do not reference escrow amounts anywhere.

5) Rules & Protections card (FULL CONTENT REPLACEMENT)
Replace entire card with EXACT copy below (no edits):

Title:
Rules & protections

Bullets:
Your money is protected  
Funds are locked securely and only released if the campaign is accepted.

No silent changes  
Campaign rules and key actions can’t be changed without being recorded.

Full visibility  
You can always see when the campaign status changes and why it changed.

6) Campaign Details section
Replace section title:
- Campaign Details → About this campaign

(No other changes)

7) Campaign Activity section
Replace section title:
- Campaign Activity → Activity timeline

Replace activity labels:
- Campaign created → Campaign opened
- Campaign closes → Campaign ends

8) Right sidebar — Join card (labels only)
Replace:
- Join this Campaign → Join this campaign
- Unit price → Commitment amount
- Minimum → Minimum commitment
Keep button text “Join campaign” unchanged

9) Participation Rules section (FULL CONTENT REPLACEMENT)
Replace header:
- PARTICIPATION RULES → Participation rules

Replace bullets with EXACT copy:
Your funds are locked safely  
Money is secured while the campaign is active.

No risk if it doesn’t go through  
If the campaign isn’t accepted or doesn’t complete, you get a full refund.

Nothing happens behind the scenes  
Every important action is recorded and visible.

-----------------------------------------------
P0-B) PRIVACY & VISIBILITY LOGIC (LOW-IMPACT)
-----------------------------------------------

Add conditional rendering ONLY (no schema changes):

- IF viewer is unauthenticated
  THEN hide all numeric financial info (unit price, minimum, totals, escrow states)

- IF viewer is authenticated but has NOT joined
  THEN hide campaign-level financials and targets
  (Join card remains, numbers appear only at final confirmation step)

- IF viewer has already joined
  THEN CTA becomes “View your commitment”
  AND show only the user’s own status (Locked / Released / Returned)
  WITHOUT showing amounts on this page

-----------------------------------------------
P0-C) JOIN FLOW CORRECTNESS
-----------------------------------------------

- IF unauthenticated user clicks “Join campaign”
  THEN open sign-in modal (no navigation, no 404)
  AFTER auth, return to same campaign and re-open Join panel

- IF campaign is not joinable (FAILED / RELEASED / COMPLETED)
  THEN disable Join CTA and show single next action: “Browse active campaigns”

-----------------------------------------------
P0-D) DEADLINE URGENCY (NON-FINANCIAL)
-----------------------------------------------

- IF Ends – now ≤ 24h
  THEN show countdown timer near CTA (“Ends in HH:MM:SS”)

- IF Ends – now ≤ 2h
  THEN add compact “Closing soon” banner under header
  AND repeat countdown inside Join card

- IF Ends – now ≤ 0
  THEN disable CTA and show “Campaign closed”

================================================
P1 — OPTIONAL (Very low cost, high reassurance)
================================================

-----------------------------------------------
P1-A) Join reassurance microcopy
-----------------------------------------------

Add one static line directly under “Join campaign” button:
“You’ll review key terms before confirming your commitment.”

-----------------------------------------------
P1-B) Language consistency sweep (THIS PAGE ONLY)
-----------------------------------------------

Replace remaining instances:
- Participants → Members
- Closes → Ends
- Building momentum → Gathering commitments

-----------------------------------------------
P1-C) Sticky CTA (reuse existing button)
-----------------------------------------------

- IF user scrolls past Join card
  THEN show sticky bottom bar with existing CTA
  AND include countdown if Ends ≤ 24h

-----------------------------------------------
IMPLEMENTATION NOTES (COST CONTROL)
-----------------------------------------------

- Perform P0-A copy replacements in a single pass
- Gate visibility with one shared helper (booleans only)
- Do NOT refactor components
- Avoid introducing new props unless necessary
- Commit P0 and P1 separately if Replit credits are constrained
