You are working on Alpmera (admin ERP/fintech-style). The Admin Campaigns module currently uses an old “Create Campaign” modal and Draft campaigns are not editable. This must be fixed.

NON-NEGOTIABLE DOCTRINE:
- Users JOIN campaigns; no buy/order/checkout language.
- Target is UNITS (integer), not money.
- Admin is authenticated via API key (not OTP).
- Campaign timelines must be append-only.
- Avoid rewrites; small, safe diffs; reuse components.

GOAL:
1) Replace “Create Campaign” modal flow with a dedicated Draft Editor page.
2) Make Draft campaigns fully editable (metadata + product definition + target + fulfillment plan).
3) Add missing product fields: media, specifications, variations (admin-only).
4) Keep list page global search + sort as-is.

IMPLEMENTATION PLAN (DO IN ORDER):

A) Campaign Creation Flow (Replace Modal)
- Remove or deprecate the current Create Campaign modal.
- Change the “Create Campaign” button on /admin/campaigns to navigate to:
  - /admin/campaigns/new  (new page)
- On /admin/campaigns/new, create a draft campaign in two steps:
  1) Minimal form: Campaign Name (required)
  2) On submit: create draft campaign record and redirect to /admin/campaigns/:id (Draft Editor)
- Optional: also allow SKU + Product Name at create time ONLY if already present, but do not block on these.

B) Draft Editor: Enable Editing (only in DRAFT lifecycleState)
On /admin/campaigns/:id implement an “Edit Draft” experience:
- If campaign.lifecycleState === DRAFT:
  - sections are editable
  - show Save actions per section or one Save Draft (whichever matches current patterns)
- If not DRAFT:
  - sections become read-only except allowed admin actions (publish, etc.)
  - never show editable inputs

C) Add Missing Sections to Campaign Detail (Admin-only)
Implement these sections on the campaign detail page (in this order), using simple forms and existing UI components:

1) Campaign Metadata (editable in DRAFT)
- name (required)
- description (optional)
- publishStatus (Draft/Published) must be controlled via explicit Publish action; not a direct toggle.

2) Product Definition (editable in DRAFT)
2.1 Specifications
- Key/value list editor
- Add row / remove row
- Validate: key non-empty, value non-empty, keys must be unique within campaign

2.2 Variations
- Variation list editor
- Each variation has:
  - variation name (required)
  - attributes map (key/value)
- Validate: variation name unique; attribute keys unique inside variation

2.3 Media
- Simple image URL list (Phase 1) OR file upload if already supported.
- Fields: url, altText (optional), sortOrder
- Validate: at least 1 image required BEFORE publish (not required to save draft)

3) Target & Progress (units)
- targetUnits (required integer > 0) editable in DRAFT
- committedUnits read-only (computed)
- Remove/avoid “Target Amount” money-type in admin; target is units.

4) Fulfillment Plan
- deliveryMode: SUPPLIER_DIRECT vs CP_BASED
- if CP_BASED: consolidationPointId required
- Editable in DRAFT and ACTIVE only until fulfillment starts (match current app rules)

5) Buyer Commitments (read-only)
- Keep existing read-only table

6) Supplier Interaction (editable based on state rules)
- Attach supplier (optional in DRAFT)
- Mark soft quote received (bool)
- Mark final acceptance (only allowed once FUNDED)

7) Campaign Timeline (append-only)
- Show list of events
- When admin changes key fields (publish, state transitions), append an event.
- Do not allow editing/deleting timeline rows.

D) State-Guarded Actions (Minimal Set)
- Add explicit buttons in “Admin Actions” section:
  - Publish (only if DRAFT + required publish preconditions met)
  - Open/Activate (only if Published and allowed)
  - Mark Funded (only if target met and rules allow)
  - Start Fulfillment (only if FUNDED)
  - Release Escrow (only if Fulfillment complete/eligible)
  - Fail Campaign (allowed pre-release)
- Ensure buttons are disabled with clear reason text if not allowed.

Publish Preconditions (must enforce):
- campaign name present
- targetUnits present (>0)
- product media has at least one image
- deliveryMode set; if CP_BASED then CP assigned

E) Data Layer: Persist New Fields
- Extend campaign data model/storage to include:
  - product: sku (optional), productName (optional)
  - specifications: array
  - variations: array
  - media: array
  - targetUnits
  - deliveryMode, consolidationPointId
- Keep backward compatibility: if older campaigns lack these fields, default to empty arrays/nulls without crashing.

F) Acceptance Tests (Must Pass)
1) Clicking “Create Campaign” opens /admin/campaigns/new (no modal)
2) Creating a campaign produces a DRAFT campaign and redirects to /admin/campaigns/:id
3) In DRAFT, admin can edit: metadata, specs, variations, media, targetUnits, fulfillment plan
4) Publish is blocked until preconditions are met (with reason shown)
5) After publish or activation, fields become read-only except allowed actions
6) List page still has search + sort, and campaign shows correct state/publish labels
7) No forbidden language: buy/order/checkout

DELIVERABLE:
- Dedicated /admin/campaigns/new page
- Draft campaigns editable with full product definition fields
- Modal removed or unused
- Publish gating implemented
