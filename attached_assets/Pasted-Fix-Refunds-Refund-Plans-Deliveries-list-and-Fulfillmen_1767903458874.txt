Fix Refunds, Refund Plans, Deliveries list, and Fulfillment Console operational usability with minimal changes and no heavy refactors.

SCOPE (ONLY):
A) /admin/refunds
B) /admin/refund-plans + /admin/refund-plans/:planId (light)
C) /admin/deliveries
D) /admin/campaigns/:campaignId/fulfillment

GUARDRAILS:
- Do NOT add new libraries.
- Do NOT change escrow ledger append-only rules or idempotency.
- Do NOT show user PII (name/email) anywhere in refunds/deliveries pages.
- Keep import workflows only where already intended:
  - Refund Plans import
  - Campaign Fulfillment import
- Avoid “manual add rows” UIs; use templates + minimal manual milestone controls.

A) Refunds page fixes:
1) Filters:
   - Ensure the status dropdown reflects actual statuses returned by backend.
   - If backend only supports Pending/Completed, keep it but ensure filtering works.
2) Reason display:
   - Map reason codes to human-readable labels (admin-safe), with raw code available as secondary/tooltip.
   - Example: campaign_failed_refund -> “Campaign failed (bulk refund)”
3) PII guard:
   - Ensure refunds list does not request or render user name/email.
   - If response includes user fields, ignore them in UI.

B) Refund Plans fixes:
1) Sorting:
   - Add a real sort control (Created, Updated, Status, Row count, Total amount).
   - Add ASC/DESC toggle.
2) Template download:
   - Add a “Download CSV template” button next to “Import Refund Plan”.
   - Provide a minimal template CSV with correct headers for import.
   - Do NOT implement manual add rows UI.
3) Keep import as DRAFT plan creation only.

C) Deliveries list fixes:
1) Sorting:
   - Add sort control: Campaign, Strategy, Status, Last Update, Next Due with ASC/DESC toggle.
2) Import discoverability:
   - Do NOT add import here.
   - Add clear CTA text/button: “Manage fulfillment updates” that navigates to the campaign fulfillment console when a row is selected/clicked.
   - Make each row link to /admin/campaigns/:campaignId/fulfillment.

D) Fulfillment Console fixes (/admin/campaigns/:campaignId/fulfillment):
1) Delivery details:
   - Add a delivery timeline section using the shared Timeline component (append-only style).
   - If no events, show “No delivery events yet.”
2) Manual milestone management (CRITICAL):
   - Add a small “Update milestone” control (single select + confirm) to create a delivery milestone event for the campaign:
     - Fulfillment scheduled
     - Fulfillment in progress
     - Shipped
     - Delivered
     - Exception raised
   - Require a short reason note (text input) before submitting.
   - This should call an existing endpoint if present; if none exists, create the minimal admin endpoint:
     - POST /api/admin/campaigns/:campaignId/fulfillment/milestone
     body: { milestone, note }
   - Must be append-only and logged; do not edit old events.
3) Import button behavior:
   - Keep “Import Delivery Updates” but make it secondary:
     - Hide or disable it when there are zero commitments.
     - Or move under a “More actions” dropdown.
4) Commitment roster:
   - Fix “No commitments found” if commitments exist by ensuring correct endpoint wiring and rendering.
   - Rename “Participants” to “Commitments” in this page text.

DELIVERABLE:
- Refunds reason labels and filter sanity; no PII.
- Refund Plans: sort + template download.
- Deliveries list: sort + rows link to fulfillment console.
- Fulfillment Console: manual milestone update + delivery timeline + import contextual.
- Short summary of changed files and any minimal new endpoint added.
- No large code dumps.
