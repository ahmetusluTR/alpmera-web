**Single low-credit Replit Agent prompt (P1.5) — NO CODE**

You are working on Alpmera (trust-first demand aggregation + escrow marketplace). Update the **Campaign Detail** page to improve conversion, reduce competitor leakage, and remove confusing/duplicate copy. Follow Alpmera doctrine: users **join campaigns** (never “buy/order/checkout”), money is **locked in escrow**, suppliers **accept campaigns**, Alpmera is **not a store**.

### P1.5 Scope Rules

* Make **targeted edits only** (no rewrites of unrelated components).
* Prefer **reusing existing components** over creating new ones.
* Do **not** change schemas or auth flows.
* If you introduce new UI labels used elsewhere (CTA text, section titles, protection bullets), implement them **globally via shared constants/components** so other pages stay consistent.

---

## A) Fix broken back navigation (conversion-critical)

* **IF** the user clicks the back arrow on Campaign Detail, **THEN** navigation must reliably return them to the previous page.
* **IF** browser history is empty or navigation fails, **THEN** route to `/campaigns` as fallback.
* **IF** a join/terms modal is open, **THEN** prevent accidental navigation (block back action or confirm close) to reduce drop-offs.

---

## B) Remove “Members” exposure (competitor leakage)

* **IF** the page currently displays `Members` anywhere (header, meta row, sidebar), **THEN** remove it from user-facing UI.
* **IF** the product uses members count to derive “Momentum”, **THEN** replace momentum with a **non-leaky** approach:

  * show **bucketed** momentum text only (e.g., “Just started / Building / Strong”), not raw member counts.
  * derive buckets from **progress-to-goal** or other non-sensitive signals.
* **IF** admins/ops need the number, **THEN** show it only for privileged roles or non-production debug mode (never for normal users).

---

## C) Deduplicate and simplify trust/protection copy (global consistency)

* **IF** the page contains overlapping sections like “Rules & protections” and “Participation rules” repeating the same promises, **THEN** merge into **one** coherent set and remove duplicates.
* **IF** any line uses insider terms (“audit trail”, “immutable”, compliance jargon), **THEN** rewrite in plain buyer language (simple, confident, non-legal).
* **IF** you rename/standardize these bullets/titles, **THEN** apply the same wording **globally** anywhere the same protections appear (campaign cards, account pages, help pages).

Required protection messages (buyer-friendly, doctrine-safe):

* Money stays locked while campaign is active; only released if campaign is accepted for execution.
* If it doesn’t go through, commitment is fully refunded.
* Key changes can’t happen silently; important updates are recorded and visible.

---

## D) Add missing Product section (images + details)

Add a product area that makes the campaign feel real and reduces uncertainty.

* **IF** campaign has product metadata, **THEN** show a **Product** section above “About this campaign” with:

  * primary image + small thumbnail gallery (3–6)
  * product name + brand (if available)
  * 3–6 spec bullets (expand/collapse if more)
  * a short “Why this campaign exists” paragraph (1–2 sentences; no hype, no discount language)
* **IF** product images are missing, **THEN** show a neutral placeholder (stable layout, no broken image UI).
* **IF** external reference links exist (manual/manufacturer), **THEN** show them in “Details” without price comparisons.

---

## E) Join module friction reduction (no store language)

* **IF** user is not signed in, **THEN** primary CTA becomes “Sign in to join” with a one-line helper: “You’ll review terms before confirming.”
* **IF** user is signed in, **THEN** CTA is “Join campaign” and opens a **terms review step** (no immediate commit).
* **IF** commitment amount equals minimum commitment, **THEN** do not show two identical rows; show a single clear minimum line.
* **IF** commitment is editable, **THEN** enforce minimum + input validation before enabling CTA.

Deadline awareness (subtle, non-hype):

* **IF** deadline is within 24 hours, **THEN** show a small countdown line (“Ends in 12h 14m”) near the deadline/CTA.
* **IF** deadline is within 60 minutes, **THEN** update countdown more frequently; otherwise update at a normal interval.

---

## F) Progress + status comprehension (reduce confusion)

* **IF** status is “Gathering commitments”, **THEN** show a one-line explainer under the status: commitments collected until goal reached or deadline ends.
* **IF** campaign status changes, **THEN** show “Last updated” timestamp near status (matches timeline expectations).
* **IF** progress crosses thresholds, **THEN** adjust progress bar emphasis (not color-hype):

  * <25% low emphasis, 25–74% medium, ≥75% high, 100% “Goal reached”.
* **IF** goal is reached and additional joining is not allowed, **THEN** replace CTA with “Join waitlist”.
* **IF** goal is reached and joining is allowed, **THEN** keep “Join campaign” and add a neutral helper: “Goal reached — joining strengthens execution certainty.”

---

## G) Timeline usefulness (not decorative)

* **IF** timeline has too few events, **THEN** add “pending” milestones in muted style (Goal reached / Supplier accepted / In execution / Completed) to set expectations.
* **IF** a milestone is pending, **THEN** label it clearly as “Not yet”.

---

## H) Reliability + loading states (conversion guardrails)

* **IF** campaign data fetch is slow, **THEN** show skeleton placeholders for Product, Join, Trust sections (avoid blank page).
* **IF** fetch fails, **THEN** show inline retry state inside the page and keep navigation usable.

## Acceptance checks (P1.5)

1. Back arrow works every time; fallback to `/campaigns` works.
2. Members count is fully removed for normal users.
3. No duplicate protection sentences; jargon removed.
4. Product section shows images + details; placeholder if missing.
5. Join CTA adapts correctly for signed-out vs signed-in users.
6. Countdown appears only when within 24 hours (subtle).
7. Status + timeline clearly communicate what happens next.
8. Any shared copy changes are applied globally via shared source-of-truth.

Implement these changes with minimal file edits and maximum reuse of existing UI components.
