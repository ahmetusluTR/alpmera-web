GOAL: Redesign ONLY the Campaign Details page layout and copy. Do not change backend logic, database schemas, auth flows, state machine, or API contracts. No rewrites—targeted edits only. Reuse existing components and styles.

CONTEXT:
- This is Alpmera. Use strict language: campaign, join, participation, escrow, release, refund, fulfillment. Never use: buy, order, checkout, cart, purchase, deal, discount, flash.
- The page already loads campaign data and has a participation wizard entry point. Keep those working.

TASK (BATCH 1): Create a new page structure with clear sections, using existing components where possible.

1) Identify the current Campaign Details page route/component (the one rendering a campaign by id/slug).
2) Refactor ONLY the JSX/TSX structure (not data fetching) into this layout order:

A. Header / Hero (top)
- Campaign title
- Short one-line “What this campaign is” helper text (neutral, trust-first)
- Status badge (AGGREGATION / SUCCESS / FULFILLMENT / RELEASED / FAILED)
- Key meta row: campaign closes date (or expiry), target participants/quantity, current progress
- If there is a countdown, keep it but make it visually secondary.

B. Primary Actions Card (right side on desktop, below on mobile)
- A “Join Campaign” / “Continue Participation” button (depending on user state)
- If user not logged in: show “Sign in to join” (but do NOT change auth logic; just keep existing behavior)
- Under CTA: 3 bullet “Participation rules” (short):
  - “Funds are locked in escrow during the campaign”
  - “If the campaign is not accepted or fails, funds are refunded”
  - “All money movements are recorded with reason + actor”
(These are copy only; do not invent new logic.)

C. Transparency Section (below hero)
Create a 3-card grid titled “Transparency”
Card 1: “Escrow Status” (show existing numbers you already display: committed total, in-escrow, released, refunded—if available; otherwise show only what exists today)
Card 2: “Campaign Milestones” (list the 5 state names with the current state highlighted; copy-only + styling)
Card 3: “Rules & Protections” (short list: append-only records, idempotency, auditable timeline — copy only)

D. Details Section
- Product / item details block (whatever exists today)
- Any supplier-facing info stays PRIVATE; do not add new supplier identity fields.

E. Timeline Section (append-only feel)
- Add a section titled “Campaign Activity”
- Reuse the existing Timeline component if it exists (you recently created/shared timeline patterns for account pages).
- If campaign already has a status history array, render it.
- If not available, render at minimum: created date, last status change date (if exists), expiry date.
DO NOT add backend calls; only render fields already present in the campaign payload.

F. FAQ / Participation Terms (bottom)
- Keep existing participation terms content, but rename the section title to “Participation Terms”
- Ensure the copy never uses forbidden words.

3) Styling requirements:
- No global redesign. Keep existing design system.
- Improve readability with spacing and consistent section headers.
- Desktop: two-column layout (content left, action card right). Mobile: stacked.

4) Safety / Non-negotiables:
- Do not change any API calls or response shapes.
- Do not change auth/session handling.
- Do not rename routes.
- Do not remove existing functionality (joining, progress, etc.). Only reorganize UI.

DELIVERABLE:
- Updated Campaign Details page UI with the above sections.
- Ensure it compiles and existing join flow still works.
