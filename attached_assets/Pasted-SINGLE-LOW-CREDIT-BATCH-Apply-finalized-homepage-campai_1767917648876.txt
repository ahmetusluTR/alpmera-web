SINGLE LOW-CREDIT BATCH — Apply finalized homepage + campaign card microcopy + minor UI wiring

GOAL:
Apply the finalized microcopy across:
- Homepage campaign sections
- Campaign list cards (public-facing)
And ensure minor wiring supports the copy rules:
- Cards show progress bar + percentage only (no amounts/units/counts)
- Access indicator text is “Member-only details”
- Public-only helper text “Sign in to view campaign details” appears only when NOT signed in
- Status labels use human-friendly UI labels (mapping layer), without changing internal codes

SCOPE (ONLY):
- Home page component(s) that render campaign sections
- Shared CampaignCard component(s) used by public/home/list
- Campaign list page component(s) (public-facing)
- Minimal auth detection logic used by these pages (existing /api/me or auth context)
- Optional: a small status-label helper (pure UI)

GUARDRAILS:
- Do NOT touch Admin pages or admin endpoints.
- Do NOT change backend business logic, escrow/ledger, idempotency, or campaign state machine.
- Do NOT add new libraries.
- Do NOT introduce store language (buy/order/cart/checkout/price/deal/discount).
- Keep edits small: prefer updating 1 shared CampaignCard and 1-2 pages.

MICROCOPY TO APPLY (EXACT):
1) Homepage title: “Campaigns”
2) Section header: “Campaigns in progress”
   Optional subtext (use only if there is already a place for it; otherwise omit):
   “Campaigns are built through collective participation. Details are private to members.”
3) Optional second section (only if it already exists; do NOT build new data flows):
   Header: “Recently completed campaigns”
   Optional subtext: “These campaigns reached their target and moved to fulfillment.”
   Limit to max 3–5 cards.
4) Card access line (always on cards): “Member-only details”
5) Public-only helper line (only when not signed in): “Sign in to view campaign details”

UI WIRING REQUIREMENTS:
A) Auth detection (lightweight)
- Determine signed-in state using existing mechanism:
  - Prefer existing auth context/store if present
  - Otherwise call existing /api/me once (client-side) and cache for the page
- Do not create new auth systems.

B) CampaignCard rendering rules
- Status: display human-friendly label via UI mapping (do NOT change internal status codes):
  AGGREGATION -> “Building momentum”
  SUCCESS -> “Target reached”
  FULFILLMENT -> “In fulfillment”
  RELEASED -> “In fulfillment”
  FAILED -> “Not completed”
- Progress: render only:
  - progress bar
  - percentage text (e.g., “72%”)
- Remove/hide from cards:
  - any $ amounts
  - any unit counts
  - any participant/commitment counts
- Add subtle milestone ticks on progress bar at 25/50/75% ONLY if it’s easy (pure CSS/markup); otherwise skip.

C) Public vs member helper text behavior
- Always show “Member-only details”
- Only show “Sign in to view campaign details” when user is NOT signed in
- Do NOT show numeric price on list cards (even for signed-in users). Price remains inside authenticated campaign detail/join flow (already implemented).

D) Header text bug fix
- Replace any “Active Campaign” header with “Campaigns”

REGRESSION CHECKS (must verify):
- Public homepage and public campaign list never show dollar amounts, prices, units, or counts.
- Signed-in users see the same cards (still no numeric price) and do NOT see the “Sign in…” helper line.
- Clicking a card still navigates to campaign detail (no broken links).
- Admin UI unaffected.

DELIVERABLE:
- Updated microcopy applied exactly.
- CampaignCard obeys the rendering rules above.
- Short summary of files changed (no big code dumps).
