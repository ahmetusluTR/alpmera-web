**P1.6 — Final Polish Replit Agent Prompt (NO CODE, low-credit, targeted edits)**

You are working on Alpmera (trust-first demand aggregation + escrow marketplace). Finalize the **Campaign Detail** page to match a clean Stripe/Vercel aesthetic and remove remaining UX debt. Follow doctrine strictly: users **join campaigns** (never buy/order/checkout), money is **locked in escrow**, suppliers **accept campaigns**, Alpmera is **not a store**. Make **small, safe changes** only. Reuse existing components. Do not change schemas/auth flows.

---

## P1.6 Goals

1. Remove duplication and “unfinished” signals
2. Fix content hierarchy so trust appears near the decision moment
3. Make “terms” useful or remove it
4. Keep everything conversion-safe and competitor-safe

If any wording/titles are shared across pages (CTAs, protection bullets, section titles), implement wording via **shared constants/components** so changes apply **globally**.

---

## A) Lock the final page structure (desktop + mobile)

### Required final order (main column)

1. **Campaign Header** (title, one-line value statement, status pills, ends + momentum)
2. **Product** (single section only)
3. **Trust & transparency** (must not be at bottom)
4. **About this campaign**
5. **Campaign timeline**

### Sidebar

* **Join this campaign** card remains in the right column and stays visually prominent (sticky on desktop if already supported; if not, don’t introduce risky new behavior).

---

## B) Remove duplicated “Product Details/Specifications”

* **IF** both “Product” and “Product Details/Specifications” sections exist, **THEN** remove the second section entirely.
* **IF** “Product Details/Specifications” contained unique content in the future, **THEN** that content must be integrated into the single **Product** section via:

  * short spec bullets (3–6)
  * optional expand/collapse for long lists
* **IF** the current UI repeats the same product card twice, **THEN** keep only one.

---

## C) Upgrade the Product section to feel “real”

Within **Product**:

* **IF** product images exist, **THEN** show:

  * one primary image
  * small thumbnail row (3–6) if multiple images exist
* **IF** product images do not exist, **THEN** show a stable placeholder (no broken image UI).
* **IF** product has a “why this campaign exists” line, **THEN** keep it short (1–2 sentences), neutral, and non-promotional.
* **IF** SKU exists, **THEN** show it in a de-emphasized style (secondary text).
* **IF** specs exist, **THEN** show 3–6 bullets; if more than 6, **THEN** collapse with “Show all specs”.

No price comparisons, no discount framing, no urgency language.

---

## D) Move Trust & transparency to the correct position

* **IF** Trust & transparency is currently below Timeline or near the bottom, **THEN** move it to be **immediately after Product** (before About + Timeline).
* **IF** Trust bullets include any jargon or “insider” terms, **THEN** rewrite to plain buyer language only.

Required trust bullets (keep concise, no repeats):

* Money stays locked while campaign is active; released only if campaign is accepted for execution.

* If it doesn’t go through, commitment is fully refunded.

* Important updates can’t happen silently; changes are recorded and visible.

* **IF** these same protection bullets appear on other pages/components, **THEN** standardize globally using shared copy constants.

---

## E) Fix / remove “Participation Terms”

Current state (“Standard campaign rules apply.”) is too vague.

* **IF** “Participation Terms” is present and contains only generic text, **THEN** remove the entire section.
* **IF** the product requires explicit terms visibility, **THEN** replace the section with 2–3 concrete, buyer-relevant bullets (not legalese) OR link to a short “Campaign Rules” modal/page. Prefer minimal implementation.

(Goal: no empty sections that reduce trust.)

---

## F) Join card micro-polish (no feature creep)

* **IF** minimum commitment is shown, **THEN** do not repeat the same number elsewhere in the card.
* **IF** deadline is within 24 hours, **THEN** add a subtle countdown line near the deadline/CTA (“Ends in 12h 14m”), no hype styling.
* **IF** user is signed out, **THEN** CTA remains “Sign in to join”; if signed in, “Join campaign”.
* Keep the helper line: “You’ll review key terms before confirming your commitment.”

Apply any CTA wording updates globally if reused.

---

## G) Spacing, hierarchy, and visual cleanup

* **IF** there are uneven paddings/margins between sections, **THEN** normalize spacing so sections align vertically and feel consistent.
* **IF** headings are inconsistent (“Campaign timeline” vs others), **THEN** standardize capitalization style across section headers.
* **IF** any section feels “tacked on” (extra divider lines, misaligned icons), **THEN** clean it to match the same card style used elsewhere.

---

## H) Acceptance checklist (must pass)

1. Only one Product section exists; no duplicated cards.
2. Trust & transparency is positioned right after Product (not at bottom).
3. Participation Terms is either removed or replaced with concrete content.
4. Page reads clean and finished with consistent spacing and headings.
5. No store language appears anywhere (buy/order/checkout).
6. No competitor leakage (no member count).
7. Any shared wording changes are applied globally via shared constants.

Implement with minimal file edits, reuse existing components, and avoid risky refactors.
