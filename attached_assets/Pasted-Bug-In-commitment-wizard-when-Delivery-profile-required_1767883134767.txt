Bug: In commitment wizard, when "Delivery profile required" is shown and user clicks "Complete profile", after saving profile the app does NOT return to the wizard confirmation step. User must manually go back to campaign and restart commitment flow.

Goal:
From within the commitment wizard:
- Clicking "Complete profile" should take the user to the profile form (either inline step or /account with a return path)
- After successful save, the user should automatically return to the wizard confirmation screen (same campaign) and the Confirm Commitment button should be enabled immediately.

Constraints:
- Do NOT change escrow logic, idempotency, campaign state machine, or admin auth.
- Only adjust navigation + state refresh between Account/Profile and Commitment Wizard.

Implementation requirements:
1) Add a return path mechanism:
- When user clicks "Complete profile" from the wizard, redirect to:
  /account?returnTo=/campaign/<campaignId>/commit
  (or whatever the wizard route is in this app)
- Include any needed query params to restore wizard state.

2) After profile save on /account:
- If returnTo is present in query string:
  - show a success toast "Profile saved"
  - redirect back to returnTo automatically
- Otherwise, stay on /account as normal.

3) Ensure wizard unlocks immediately after returning:
- On wizard mount (or on focus), refetch /api/me (or invalidate auth/me query) so profile completeness is recalculated using updated data.
- Remove any stale cached profile causing the gating card to persist.

4) UX:
- Keep it trust-first language.
- No "checkout", no "order".
- Button label can remain "Complete profile".

5) Add a test:
- scripts/test-profile-return.ts (or extend existing test)
Flow:
  - login
  - open commitment wizard route for a campaign
  - detect profile required
  - simulate profile update call
  - verify redirect back to wizard route occurs when returnTo is set

Return:
- file paths changed (likely client/src/pages/commitment-wizard.tsx, client/src/pages/account.tsx, and auth/me query hook)
- exact redirect behavior
- confirmation that after saving profile from wizard, user lands back on confirmation step without restarting
