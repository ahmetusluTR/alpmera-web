Rewrite Batch B to ONLY implement admin publish controls + edit locks for campaigns. Part 1 (sorting/naming) is already fixed—do not touch it.

GOAL:
Admins can create campaigns as DRAFT templates/placeholders, then PUBLISH them to make them visible/joinable. After publish, most campaign fields become read-only, except consolidation-related fields (until campaign enters fulfillment phase). Also allow HIDE as an emergency visibility control.

SCOPE (ONLY Campaign Admin):
- /admin/campaigns (list: show publish status pill; add Create Campaign flow if it’s not already present)
- /admin/campaigns/:campaignId (detail: show publish status, actions, edit lock behavior)
- Minimal backend endpoints/validation to enforce publish transitions and field locks.
Do NOT modify escrow, ledger, commitments, refunds, releases, deliveries pages in this batch.

NON-NEGOTIABLE GUARDRAILS:
- Do NOT change campaign state machine logic (AGGREGATION/SUCCESS/FULFILLMENT/RELEASED/FAILED etc.). This feature is separate from the state machine.
- Do NOT add new libraries.
- Do NOT refactor unrelated admin code.
- Enforce restrictions server-side (UI-only disabling is not enough).
- Language rules: use “publish”, “hide”, “draft”, “campaign”. No store language.

FEATURE DESIGN (IMPLEMENT EXACTLY):

1) Add admin publish status field (separate from campaign state machine)
- New campaign field: admin_publish_status ENUM with values:
  - DRAFT (default on create)
  - PUBLISHED
  - HIDDEN
- This field controls visibility in the public UI (if that logic exists) and editability in admin.

2) Campaign creation
- Ensure Create Campaign creates campaigns with admin_publish_status = DRAFT.
- If Create Campaign already exists, keep it; just ensure default is DRAFT.
- If Create Campaign does NOT exist yet, add a minimal “Create Campaign” modal on /admin/campaigns with required fields:
  - name (required)
  - deadline (required)
  - sku (required)
  - product_name (required)
  - delivery_strategy (required: SUPPLIER_DIRECT | BULK_TO_CONSOLIDATION)
  - consolidation fields required only if BULK_TO_CONSOLIDATION:
    consolidation_contact_name
    consolidation_address_line1
    consolidation_address_line2 (optional)
    consolidation_city
    consolidation_state
    consolidation_postal_code
    consolidation_country
    consolidation_phone (optional)
- On success navigate to /admin/campaigns/:campaignId.

3) Publish/Hide controls (Campaign detail)
On /admin/campaigns/:campaignId:
- Display admin_publish_status as a pill: DRAFT / PUBLISHED / HIDDEN
- Add actions (buttons) with confirmations:
  - If DRAFT: show “Publish campaign”
  - If PUBLISHED: show “Hide campaign”
  - If HIDDEN: show “Republish campaign” (optional; implement if low effort)
- Publishing must be explicit and require confirmation text like: “Publishing makes the campaign visible and joinable.”

Backend endpoints (reuse existing admin auth x-admin-auth; add only if missing):
- POST /api/admin/campaigns/:campaignId/publish
  - transitions DRAFT or HIDDEN -> PUBLISHED
- POST /api/admin/campaigns/:campaignId/hide
  - transitions PUBLISHED -> HIDDEN
Return updated campaign summary including admin_publish_status.

4) Edit locks after publish (UI + backend enforcement)
- While admin_publish_status = DRAFT:
  - campaign details are editable (existing form behavior ok)
- When admin_publish_status = PUBLISHED or HIDDEN:
  - disable editing for all fields EXCEPT consolidation-related fields (below) UNTIL campaign enters fulfillment phase.
  - show a small banner: “This campaign is published; core fields are locked.”

Consolidation fields (allowed edits while published, but only until fulfillment phase):
- consolidation_contact_name
- consolidation_company (if exists)
- consolidation_address_line1
- consolidation_address_line2
- consolidation_city
- consolidation_state
- consolidation_postal_code
- consolidation_country
- consolidation_phone
- delivery_window
- fulfillment_notes

Lock timing:
- Allow consolidation field edits only while campaign state is NOT in fulfillment phase.
- Treat “fulfillment phase” as: campaign.state is one of [FULFILLMENT, RELEASED] (or your equivalents). Use your existing state constants.
- Once campaign enters fulfillment phase, consolidation fields become locked too (read-only), and the UI should show: “Fulfillment started; delivery settings are locked.”

Backend enforcement (required):
- In the admin campaign update endpoint (PATCH/PUT /api/admin/campaigns/:campaignId or equivalent):
  - If admin_publish_status != DRAFT:
    - Reject changes to any locked fields with 400 and a clear message listing disallowed fields.
  - If campaign is in fulfillment phase:
    - Reject consolidation edits too.
- If you don’t have a campaign update endpoint yet, add the minimal PATCH endpoint needed to update consolidation fields while published.

5) Campaign list surface
On /admin/campaigns:
- Add a small “Publish status” column or pill in the existing Name cell.
- Do NOT change existing sorting work.

6) Visibility rule (if public UI uses it)
- If there is an existing public campaigns query, ensure it only returns campaigns where admin_publish_status = PUBLISHED.
- If that’s out of scope or risky, do NOT change public logic now; just implement admin publish status + edit locks. (Prefer safety.)

DELIVERABLES:
- Campaigns can be created as DRAFT.
- Campaign detail can be published/hidden with explicit confirmations.
- After publish, core fields are read-only; only consolidation fields editable until fulfillment phase.
- Server-side validation enforces all locks.
- Short summary of changed files and endpoints (no large code dumps).
