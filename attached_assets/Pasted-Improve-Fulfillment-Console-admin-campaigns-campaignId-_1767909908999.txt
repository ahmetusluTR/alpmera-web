Improve Fulfillment Console (/admin/campaigns/:campaignId/fulfillment) to be operationally usable and supplier-ready.

SCOPE (ONLY):
- Add supplier-facing exports of eligible records (strategy-aware):
  - SUPPLIER_DIRECT: direct manifest includes recipient delivery data
  - BULK_TO_CONSOLIDATION: bulk manifest includes consolidation destination + totals (no end-user PII)
- Add “Download Import Template” for delivery updates and inline schema help
- Ensure manual milestone updates exist (append-only events)
- Keep Deliveries list page changes minimal: make rows link to fulfillment console and add sort UI if already present, but DO NOT add import to /admin/deliveries.

GUARDRAILS:
- Do NOT add carrier integrations.
- Do NOT add heavy libraries.
- All exports must be “eligible-only” (server-derived).
- Do NOT expose public pricing; admin PII is allowed only in SUPPLIER_DIRECT export.
- Log exports (audit event) without storing exported content.

REQUIREMENTS:

1) Export: eligible-only, strategy-aware
On Fulfillment Console add an “Exports” area with ONE button depending on delivery strategy:
A) If SUPPLIER_DIRECT:
  Button: “Export supplier fulfillment manifest (direct)”
  CSV columns:
    commitment_code,sku,product_name,quantity,
    recipient_name,address_line1,address_line2,city,state,postal_code,country,
    phone,email,delivery_notes
B) If BULK_TO_CONSOLIDATION:
  Button: “Export supplier fulfillment manifest (bulk)”
  CSV columns:
    sku,product_name,total_quantity,
    consolidation_contact_name,consolidation_company,
    consolidation_address_line1,consolidation_address_line2,consolidation_city,
    consolidation_state,consolidation_postal_code,consolidation_country,
    consolidation_phone,delivery_window,fulfillment_notes

Eligibility rules (server-derived; keep minimal):
- include commitments in this campaign that are not refunded/cancelled and not already delivered and not in exception.
- if you don’t have per-commitment delivery state yet, use safest approximation and document it in code comments.

Backend endpoints (reuse if exist; otherwise add minimal):
- GET /api/admin/campaigns/:campaignId/fulfillment/export/direct
- GET /api/admin/campaigns/:campaignId/fulfillment/export/bulk
These should return a CSV download.

Also write an audit event per export:
- eventType: FULFILLMENT_EXPORT_CREATED
- payload: { campaignId, strategy, rowCount }

2) Import template + schema help (delivery updates)
In the “Import Delivery Updates” dialog (or More actions menu):
- Add a “Download CSV template” button.
- Show inline schema:
  Required: commitment_code, milestone_code
  Optional: carrier, tracking_url, note
  Allowed milestone_code values (codes, not labels):
    FULFILLMENT_SCHEDULED, IN_PROGRESS, SHIPPED, DELIVERED, EXCEPTION
This aligns with the global rule: code-based fields use codes.

Template CSV header:
commitment_code,milestone_code,carrier,tracking_url,note

3) Manual milestone updates (append-only)
The “Update Milestone” action must create an append-only event.
- UI: select milestone_code + enter note (required) + confirm.
- Backend: if endpoint doesn’t exist, add minimal:
  POST /api/admin/campaigns/:campaignId/fulfillment/milestone
  body: { milestone_code, note }
- Must not update/delete old events.

4) Delivery timeline
- Render append-only milestone events (existing Timeline component).
- If none: show “No delivery events yet.”

5) Deliveries list (/admin/deliveries) minimal improvements
- Make rows link to /admin/campaigns/:campaignId/fulfillment
- Add sort controls only if currently missing and it’s low-touch; otherwise defer.

DELIVERABLE:
- Fulfillment Console exports work and are strategy-aware.
- Import template and schema guidance visible.
- Manual milestone update works and timeline updates.
- Short summary of changed files/endpoints.
