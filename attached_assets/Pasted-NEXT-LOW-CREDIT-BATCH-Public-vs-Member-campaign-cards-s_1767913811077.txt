NEXT LOW-CREDIT BATCH — Public vs Member campaign cards + seed a few PUBLISHED campaigns

GOAL:
- Public users (not signed in) see only: progress bar + percentage (no price, no $ amounts, no units/counts).
- Signed-in normal users (“members”) can see a member-only card view that still avoids leaking unit economics:
  - show “Member-only terms” instead of a numeric price on list cards
  - pricing remains visible only inside authenticated campaign detail/join flow (already implemented).
- Ensure only PUBLISHED campaigns appear on Home/Campaigns.
- Update seed/test data so a few campaigns are PUBLISHED by default, otherwise UI will look empty (since default is DRAFT).

SCOPE (ONLY):
- Public Home page campaign section(s)
- Public Campaigns listing page (if separate)
- Shared CampaignCard used by those pages
- Public campaigns API endpoint(s) used by those pages (filter + redact)
- Seed/test data for campaigns (dev only)

GUARDRAILS:
- Do NOT touch Admin pages/components.
- Do NOT change escrow/ledger/idempotency/auth flows.
- Do NOT add libraries.
- No store language (no buy/order/cart/checkout).
- Keep changes minimal: prefer 1 shared card component + 1 public endpoint + 1 seed script update.

REQUIREMENTS:

1) Backend: public campaign feed filters by publish status
- Public campaign list endpoint must return only campaigns where admin_publish_status = PUBLISHED.
- DRAFT/HIDDEN must never appear in public/member lists.

2) Backend: redact monetary fields from public/list payload
- Public/list payload must NOT include any monetary fields (target_amount, current_amount, unit price, totals).
- If member list uses same endpoint, still redact money to avoid list leakage.

3) Frontend: two card modes (Public vs Member)
- Detect signed-in state via existing /api/me (or existing auth context).
- Render CampaignCard in:
  A) PUBLIC MODE (not signed in):
     - Show: status pill, progress bar, percentage, optional time remaining
     - Do NOT show: price, $ amounts, units, participant/commitment counts
     - Show a small line: “Sign in to view member terms”
  B) MEMBER MODE (signed in normal user):
     - Still DO NOT show numeric price on list cards
     - Instead show a badge/line: “Member-only terms” (no numbers)
     - Keep percent-only progress same as public
     - CTA remains “View campaign” / “View details” (no store language)
- Pricing stays only on authenticated campaign detail / join flow (already implemented). Do not change that.

4) Visual tweaks (light)
- Progress bar includes subtle milestone ticks at 25/50/75% (no labels).
- Add a qualitative label under percent (non-numeric):
  - <40%: “Building momentum”
  - 40–70%: “Gaining traction”
  - 70–99%: “Approaching target”
  - 100%: “Target reached”

5) Seed/test data: ensure multiple campaigns are PUBLISHED by default (dev only)
- Update seed script / test data initializer so at least 3 sample campaigns have:
  admin_publish_status = PUBLISHED
- Leave others as DRAFT to reflect real workflow.
- Do NOT auto-publish in production code paths; this is dev seed only.

6) Regression checks
- Public Home/Campaigns never shows $ amounts or numeric prices.
- Signed-in member Home/Campaigns still shows no numeric prices; shows “Member-only terms” instead.
- Only PUBLISHED campaigns appear for non-admin users.
- Admin pages remain unchanged.

DELIVERABLE:
- Public vs Member campaign cards behave as specified.
- Seed data shows multiple published campaigns so UI is not empty in dev.
- Short summary of files/endpoints changed.
